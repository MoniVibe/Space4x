# Mechanic: Carrier Customization & Progression

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Complex  
**Category**: Fleet / Progression

**One-line description**: Capital ships feature Battletech-style variants with modular sections, hulls, hardpoints, and modules; long service grants traits while refits adapt roles to emerging needs.

## Capital Ship Variants

- Models offer Common, Uncommon, Heroic, and Prototype variants, each with unique names and built-in systems.
- Higher rarity grants higher quality components and exclusive subsystems, maintaining balance via rarity scarcity.
- Variants mirror Battletech inspiration—recognizable chassis with divergent loadouts.

## Modular Architecture

- **Sections**: Forward, mid, aft, and spine segments configurable independently.
- **Hulls**: Swappable plating influences durability, mass, and signatures.
- **Hardpoints**: Weapon/utility slots by size; variant defaults can be overridden for custom builds.
- **Modules**: Hangars, warp cores, manufacturing bays, habitat pods, labs.

## Specialization & Roles

- Civilian carriers typically ship with freighter or logistics modules.
- Military variants feature hardened hulls and superior weapon systems.
- Role specialization is flexible: any carrier can attempt tasks outside its design with reduced efficiency.

## Service Traits

- Carriers accrue service history, unlocking traits that grant morale boosts, reliability, or niche bonuses.
- Traits reflect narrative milestones (e.g., "Pirate-Bane" raises pirate deterrence).

## Refit Permissions

- Captains propose refits; approval depends on ownership (player-controlled carriers require consent).
- Refit requests consider resource availability, facility capacity, and downtime implications.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Combat Loop**: Hardpoint choices dictate combat roles; hull armor influences survivability.
- **Haul/Mining/Construction Loops**: Module swaps support hauling (cargo pods), mining (rig bays), construction (fabricators).
- **AI Commanders**: Evaluate whether modifications align with doctrine and mission needs.
- **Economy**: High-rarity components command premium markets, fueling trade and black markets.
