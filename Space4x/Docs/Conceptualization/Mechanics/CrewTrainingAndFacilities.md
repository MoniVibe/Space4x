# Mechanic: Crew Training & Facility Support

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Crew / Infrastructure

**One-line description**: Training facilities and academies develop departmental expertise, mitigating fatigue and unlocking advanced ship capabilities.

## Training Infrastructure

- **Shipboard Facilities**: Simulation pods, gunnery ranges, engineering labs embedded within capital ships.
- **Station/Colony Academies**: Dedicated campuses offering long-term training programs; quality scales with tech level.
- **Virtual Training**: PureDOTS-compatible VR scenarios accessible during downtime.

## Training Mechanics

- Departments schedule training rotations to refresh skills and reduce fatigue/stress.
- Higher tech academies accelerate skill gain, grant specialized perks (e.g., shield harmonics, advanced logistics).
- Training invests resources/time; overtraining risks morale loss if exploited.

## Service Traits Interaction

- Departments with extensive training unlock service traits faster.
- Traits feed back into morale and performance (e.g., "Elite Engineers" reduce repair times).

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Crew Systems**: Training directly adjusts department averages and fatigue recovery.
- **Carrier Customization**: Modules reserved for training limit cargo/weapon slots, demanding trade-offs.
- **Economy & Corruption**: Corrupt academies may inflate credentials; high integrity boosts real outcomes.
- **Tech Progression**: Higher-tier tech unlocks new curricula and training sims.
