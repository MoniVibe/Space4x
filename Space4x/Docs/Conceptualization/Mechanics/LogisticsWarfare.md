# Mechanic: Logistics Warfare & Salvage

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Warfare / Economy

**One-line description**: Supply lines keep fleets alive; cutting logistics cripples enemy forces unless they escape or improvise, and derelicts/parlays offer alternative recovery paths.

## Supply Dynamics

- Fleets rely on haulers for fuel, ammunition, and life support while operating.
- Gas giants and planets provide emergency energy harvesting options when shortages occur.
- Carriers can operate long stretches without docking but eventually require resupply hubs or hauler support.

## Logistics Disruption

- Targeting enemy supply lines can induce hunger, mutiny, or operational collapse.
- Sustained denial is difficult unless jump denial facilities prevent retreat.
- Strategic chokepoints become vital for logistics defense/offense.

## Salvage & Parlay

- Derelicts can be claimed for resources or reactivated ships.
- Parlay opportunities depend on outlooks/alignment: cooperative factions negotiate, hostile ones refuse.
- Derelict recovery decisions follow doctrine—materialists risk dangerous salvage for ancient tech, warlikes prioritize weapon recovery, etc. Space hulks may harbor dead crews or alien fauna.
- Ships become derelict when crew falls below ~10% or command staff lost; lawful crews defer to rank structure to reclaim or evacuate before abandoning.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Combat Loop**: Engagements over logistics routes become high stakes.
- **Mission Board**: Contracts emerge to protect or disrupt supply lines.
- **Economy**: Logistics costs and hazard pay influence market prices.
- **Diplomacy**: Parlay outcomes shift relations; derelict claims raise territorial disputes.
