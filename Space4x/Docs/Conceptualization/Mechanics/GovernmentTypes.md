# Mechanic: Government Types & Policy Effects

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Governance

**One-line description**: Government forms (democracy, corporatocracy, military junta, etc.) influence morale, taxation, rebellion risk, and policy levers.

## Government Impact

- **Morale**: Certain populations respond better to aligned governance; mismatches drive dissent.
- **Taxation**: Government type dictates base tax rates, efficiency, and corruption resilience.
- **Rebellion**: Authoritarian regimes face sharper rebellion when morale dips; democracies weather discontent longer but risk instability if policies fail.
- **Policy Levers**: Each government form offers unique policy cards (martial law, corporate subsidies, civic reforms).

## Player Interaction

- Players invest resources into projects; AI leadership applies government rules to handle ongoing policy decisions.
- Switching government type requires conditions (tech, morale thresholds) and triggers situations.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Law & Rebellion**: Government modifiers feed into compliance checks.
- **Economy**: Taxation impacts mission rewards and market prices.
- **Diplomacy**: Government alignment affects treaty offers and trust.
