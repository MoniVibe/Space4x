# Mechanic: Fleet Composition & Logistics

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Complex  
**Category**: Fleet / Logistics

**One-line description**: Fleets range from single massive entities to distributed task groups, constrained by docking capacity, crew limits, and logistical roles.

## Fleet Structure

- Fleets can assemble as singular massive formations or break into smaller bands for specialized tasks (resupply, counter-ops, patrols, personnel transport).
- AI and players manage sub-groups dynamically, ensuring coverage of mission objectives.

## Composition Constraints

- **Docking Capacity**: Each carrier model/tech tier defines docking slots for escorts, shuttles, and drones.
- **Crew Limits**: Carriers impose crew thresholds; exceeding them lowers morale and efficiency.
- **Command Load**: Fleet command AI considers total hull count and service traits when assigning captains.
- **Warp Range**: Larger carriers with bigger warp drives extend fleet operational radius; small carriers rely on light carriers for interstellar hops.
- **Resupply Dependence**: Carriers operate long periods without docking but eventually require resupply unless supported by haulers or local energy harvesting.

## Role Distribution

- Fleets maintain balanced wings: logistics, combat, exploration, and construction support.
- Civilian carriers plug into trade and transport; military carriers anchor combat formations.
- Task forces reconfigure based on situations (energy crisis prompts more logistics runs, etc.).

## AI Considerations

- AI respects docking limits, crew capacity, and specialization when dispatching carriers.
- Service traits and morale influence assignment—trusted carriers lead risky missions.
- Doctrine policies adjust composition (e.g., defensive empires keep more escorts with civilian convoys).

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Population Logistics**: Passenger carriers integrate with fleet logistics for migration.
- **Carrier Customization**: Modules chosen per fleet role; docking limits inform configuration.
- **Morale Dynamics**: Overcrowded or under-supported fleets suffer morale penalties.
- **Tech Progression**: Upgrades expand docking capacity and warp range.
