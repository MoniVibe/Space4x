# Mechanic: Culture Flexibility & Outlook Signature Tech

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Lore / Technology

**One-line description**: Species adopt cultures fluidly unless fanatic xenophobia applies; outlook combinations unlock signature technologies tied to alignment and education levels.

## Culture Flexibility

- Species are not locked to specific cultures—families and environments shape cultural identity.
- Fanatic xenophobes resist cultural exchange, maintaining rigid identities.
- Chaotic entities evolve culture more readily over time.

## Signature Technology

- Every outlook combination grants access to unique tech unlocks (e.g., pacifist-trade modules, authoritarian defense grids).
- Alignment and education level gates determine availability and mastery.
- Signature tech reinforces faction personality while allowing cross-cultural diversity.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Diplomacy Dynamics**: Shared signature tech paths encourage alliances; conflicting tech fosters rivalry.
- **Tech Progression**: Education investments influence how quickly signature tech disseminates.
- **Dynamic Events**: Cultural shifts or tech breakthroughs spawn narrative hooks.
