# Mechanic: Command Interface & Megaproject Requirements

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: UX / Megaprojects

**One-line description**: Players command via a Homeworld-inspired spatial interface while gigastructures demand advanced tech milestones and logistical investment.

## Command Interface

- **Homeworld Inspiration**: 3D spatial view with tactical layers, allowing fleet selection, waypoint plotting, and group commands directly in space.
- **Layered Views**: Toggle between galaxy, sector, and local tactical overlays for carriers, colonies, and routes.
- **Delegation Tools**: Queue tasks for AI captains/fleets, review orders, and adjust priorities from the same interface.
- **Time Controls**: Pause/slow/fast-forward seamlessly integrated with the command HUD.
- **Reports**: Initially, players manage directly; optional future tabs may provide specialized reports (logistics, tactical, diplomacy).
- **Accessibility & QoL**: Configurable input schemes, automation toggles for repetitive tasks, and captain delegation options that let captains make decisions following their outlooks/alignment when granted authority.
- **Automation Policies**: Fully customizable scripts for auto-routes, resource balancing, and situation responses; AI follows outlook/alignment, with chaotic profiles occasionally diverging unpredictably.

## Gigastrcuture/Megaproject Requirements & Impacts

- **Tech Milestones**: Each megaproject (Dyson spheres, ringworlds, jump gates) requires specific tech unlocks before construction begins.
- **Resource & Logistical Investment**: Massive resource quotas, specialized carriers, and dedicated facility tiers.
- **Phased Construction**: Situations framework tracks stages (foundation, assembly, calibration) with events along the way.
- **Defense & Diplomacy**: Building megaprojects attracts attention; command interface highlights threat vectors and diplomatic repercussions.
- **Galactic Impact Examples**:
  - **Gateways**: Reshape trade routes, affecting prices and regional power balances.
  - **Dyson Spheres**: Enable ecumenopolis-scale colonies, redefining system economies.
  - **Yggdrasil Compound**: Ends galactic hunger, altering diplomacy and morale.
  - **Matrioshka Brains**: Spawn near-independent superintelligences operating at extreme efficiency.
- Builders of megastructures become near demigods, wielding empire-defining bonuses and narrative influence.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Construction Loop**: Uses high-tier facilities and carrier modules documented earlier.
- **Tech Progression**: Megaproject tech gates sync with diffusion systems (core → fringe rollout).
- **Dynamic Events**: Megaproject milestones spawn story events; failure can trigger crises.
- **Time Control**: Slow/fast modes help manage lengthy build phases.
