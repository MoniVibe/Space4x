# Mechanic: Telemetry HUD & Analytics

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: UX / Analytics

**One-line description**: In-game HUDs aggregate stats across aggregates and totals—villager counts, outlook distributions, prosperity, and more.

## HUD Components

- **Population Panels**: Show total inhabitants, departmental staffing, casualties.
- **Outlook/Alignment Charts**: Visualize ideological spread per colony, fleet, or empire.
- **Prosperity Metrics**: Track economic output, resource inflow/outflow, trade balance.
- **Espionage & Security**: Display infiltration levels, suspicion scores, counterintel readiness.
- **Situation Alerts**: Surface active situations with phase progress and response options.

## Aggregation Levels

- Drill-down by aggregate (colony, fleet, guild) or view empire-wide totals.
- Historical graphs for trend analysis (requires telemetry buffers).

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Command Interface**: HUD overlays tie into the Homeworld-inspired view.
- **Situations Framework**: Data feeds from situations update HUD in real time.
- **Morale Dynamics**: Charts highlight morale variance hotspots.
- **Economy**: Prosperity metrics inform mission board and trade decisions.
