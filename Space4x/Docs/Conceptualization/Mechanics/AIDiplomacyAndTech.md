# Mechanic: AI Diplomacy & Tech Priorities

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Complex  
**Category**: AI / Diplomacy / Technology

**One-line description**: AI empires negotiate and pursue technology according to their outlooks, producing honest brokers, duplicitous regimes, or zealots with focused tech agendas.

## Diplomacy Behavior

- **Alignment-Driven**: Diplomatic offers, treaty adherence, and betrayal chances stem from alignment/outlook overlap.
- **Corrupt Actors**: Corrupt or low-integrity factions may accept deals they never intend to honor, exacerbating distrust and triggering law/rebellion systems.
- **Pure/Good Entities**: Seek mutually beneficial resolutions; they invest in ambassadors to resolve conflict amicably.
- **Evil Entities**: Leverage diplomacy for advantage, often escalating conflicts or exploiting loopholes.
- **Neutral Pragmatists**: Evaluate deals on utilitarian value; outcomes vary 50/50 when ethics are balanced.

## Tech Pursuit

- **Materialist Factions**: Obsess over technological advancement, building relays, research labs, and pursuing pacts aggressively.
- **Spiritual Factions**: Prioritize doctrines, culture, or psionic paths; they may ignore or slow tech diffusion unless it reinforces their beliefs.
- **Balanced Outlooks**: Maintain moderate tech progression to stay competitive without overcommitting.
- **Fanatic Variation**: Fanatic alignments double down (e.g., Fanatic Materialists risk conflict to secure tech; Fanatic Spiritualists resist foreign tech adoption).

## Decision Inputs

- Morale and task alignment influence whether AI doubles down on diplomacy, reforms, or aggression.
- Threat pressure encourages unlikely alliances; trust decays faster if corrupt factions renege on promises.
- Tech lag versus rivals triggers catch-up plans for pragmatic factions (relay construction, trade deals) while zealots stay insular.
- Captains seldom advocate megaprojects unless tech level is far ahead; governors initiate long-term strategies when doctrine, resources, and projections align.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Tech Progression**: AI invests in diffusion infrastructure proportionate to outlook priorities.
- **Diplomacy Dynamics**: Inform ambassador behavior, treaty offer frequency, and betrayal probability.
- **Law & Rebellion**: Diplomatic behavior affects internal stability—corrupt deals can spark unrest.
- **Combat Loop**: Diplomatic failure or success alters AI threat posture and willingness to engage.
