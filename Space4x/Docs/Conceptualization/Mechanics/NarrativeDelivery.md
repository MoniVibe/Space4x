# Mechanic: Narrative Delivery & Environmental Lore

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Narrative

**One-line description**: Storytelling surfaces through crew quotes triggered by locations or events, and environmental artifacts like debris fields with textual logs.

## Crew Quotes

- Text-only lines delivered by relevant officers when entering zones or triggering key events.
- Examples:
  - Reaver space: “Comms are filled with the screams of the tortured, maybe it's best to keep chatter to a minimum when moving through reaver space, sir.” — Comms Officer <Name>
  - Unique station (Phalanx in Sol): “Once, Phalanx bestrode the stars as a colossus of war, but now its zenith has passed...”
- Quotes reinforce atmosphere, lore, and current risks without voiceover.

## Environmental Storytelling

- Systems may contain debris fields, black boxes, and relics that unlock textual logs.
- Logs provide mini-stories, clues for missions, or hints to megaprojects and crises.
- Discoveries integrate with exploration and dynamic events.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Command Interface**: Quotes overlay unobtrusively; logs accessible via HUD panels.
- **Dynamic Events**: Trigger scripted quote series or unlock new logs.
- **Telemetry HUD**: Track discovered logs and quote archives.
- **Mission Board**: Lore discoveries can spawn new contracts.
