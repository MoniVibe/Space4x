# Mechanic: Espionage & Infiltration

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Complex  
**Category**: Intelligence / Covert Ops

**One-line description**: Spy bands embed within rival entities, building infiltration levels over time to unlock intel, sabotage, and command subversion.

## Core Concept

Spies operate as contracted bands serving larger entities (empires, guilds, corporations) in exchange for payment or favors. They insert themselves through multiple vectors—conscription, celebrity, hacking, blackmail—and progressively deepen their influence.

## Infiltration Levels

| Level | Description | Benefits |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 0 | Initial contact | Limited intel, access to public data |
| 1 | Embedded | Vision sharing of local fleets/stations |
| 2 | Trusted | Intercept communications, minor sabotage |
| 3 | Influential | Steal tech secrets, manipulate trade routes |
| 4 | Command Subversion | Issue false orders, compromise crisis responses |

Progression depends on mission success, time, and resisting counterintelligence. Exposure resets or penalizes the infiltrating band.

## Infiltration Methods

- **Conscription**: Spies enlist into rival militaries or fleets.
- **Fame/Popularity Harvesting**: Become public figures or heroes to gain access.
- **Hacking**: Breach digital infrastructure, forge credentials.
- **Blackmail**: Exploit personal secrets to secure cooperation.
- **Cultural Integration**: Adopt rival customs to pass loyalty checks.

## Extraction & Risk

- Spy bands plan exfiltration from the outset, coordinating safe exit routes.
- Severe espionage exposure triggers diplomatic fallout, potentially escalating to war.

## Countermeasures

- Security policies, morale monitoring, and tech upgrades (cyber defense suites) reduce infiltration rate.
- High integrity leadership and low corruption impede spy gains.
- Exposed spies trigger situations (tribunals, purges) influencing morale and diplomacy.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Diplomacy**: Spies can sway negotiations or poison alliances.
- **Tech Progression**: Tech theft accelerates diffusion; stolen secrets may skip tiers.
- **Law & Rebellion**: Exposure can spark witch hunts or legitimate reforms.
- **Morale Dynamics**: Populations react to espionage revelations based on outlook alignment.
- **Situations Framework**: Failed or exposed ops spawn ongoing situations with branching outcomes.

## Tuning Guidance

- Balance infiltration speed so counterintelligence matters without trivializing espionage.
- Ensure payoffs scale with risk—high-level infiltration should feel game-changing but rare.
- Provide non-lethal resolution paths (diplomatic swaps, mutual amnesty) alongside punitive measures.
