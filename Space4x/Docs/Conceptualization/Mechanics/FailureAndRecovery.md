# Mechanic: Failure & Recovery Loops

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Progression

**One-line description**: On collapse, the player respawns as an orphaned mining vessel, rebuilding slowly rather than facing a hard game over.

## Collapse Handling

- If core carriers are destroyed or the empire falls, transition the player into a humble mining ship with minimal resources.
- Legacy assets may be gone or seized; player rebuilds through mining, trading, and opportunistic contracts.
- No distinct post-game; campaign continues via recovery play.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Mining Loop**: Recovery relies on mining profitability and safety.
- **Mission Board**: Initial contracts provide stepping stones back to power.
- **Dynamic Events**: Recovery may trigger unique events (sympathy aid, pirate harassment).
