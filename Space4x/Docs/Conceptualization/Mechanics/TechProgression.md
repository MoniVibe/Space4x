# Mechanic: Tech Progression & Diffusion

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Technology / Economy

**One-line description**: Research advances per player, empire, or colony, then diffuses outward over time based on proximity, infrastructure, and diplomatic ties.

## Core Concept

Technology unlocks originate from specific research nodes—capitals, dedicated labs, or pioneering fleets—and spread gradually through the empire. Distance, infrastructure, and tech tier determine diffusion lag, so fringe worlds often operate a generation behind the core unless logistics and diplomacy accelerate knowledge sharing.

## Research Sources

- **Player/Capital Labs**: Primary unlock point; gains full access to new tech immediately.
- **Colony Labs**: Generate local tech suited to planetary modifiers; may diverge from imperial focus.
- **Fleet/Carrier Labs**: Mobile research expeditions that specialize in field adaptations or salvaged discoveries.

## Diffusion Mechanics

1. **Unlock Event**: Research lab completes a technology, adding it to the source node’s arsenal.
2. **Propagation Queue**: Tech enters a diffusion queue with travel time determined by:
   - Distance from source (jump count, relay network quality).
   - Infrastructure tier (Logistics Hubs, Research Relays, cultural ties).
   - Tech tier (higher tiers propagate slower without relays).
3. **Adoption**: Target colonies, fleets, or stations receive the tech, unlocking new facility tiers, doctrines, or blueprints.
4. **Decay**: If logistics break or relations sour, diffusion pauses or regresses.

## Diplomatic Sharing

- **Trade Agreements**: Partner empires exchange tech passively at reduced rates; diffusion speed scales with trust and shared outlooks.
- **Research Pacts**: Formal agreements that synchronize research queues, allowing shared breakpoints.
- **Espionage**: Spies can siphon diffusion queues, granting premature access or sabotaging rivals’ spread.

## Starting Mode Influence

- Starting configurations determine initial tech tiers, access to labs, and whether diffusion infrastructure exists.
- Nomadic starts may possess advanced mobile labs but lack relay networks, delaying empire-wide adoption.
- Fringe coping strategies depend on the corruption level of local governors or empire policy; corrupt leaders hoard knowledge or turn to black markets, while idealists encourage improvisation and local innovation.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Facility Archetypes**: Higher tiers require specific tech unlocks; diffusion pace controls how quickly remote colonies can upgrade.
- **Morale Dynamics**: Fringe worlds falling behind experience morale penalties, especially among progressive outlooks.
- **Diplomacy**: Shared outlooks invite cooperative research; ideological mismatches slow or block tech sharing even under treaty.
- **Threat Scaling**: Alien empires and pirates adapt over time; tech diffusion determines if players stay ahead of the curve.

## Tuning Guidance

- Keep diffusion delays meaningful (minutes to hours of game time) without stalling progress.
- Provide player tools (relay stations, courier fleets) to intentionally accelerate spread.
- Ensure tech trees branch so different starting modes have unique strengths while remaining interoperable through trade.
- Tech tree is vast—from basic lasers to Matrioshka brains; a single playthrough reveals only a subset, with unique tech locked behind faction outlooks/alignment/culture.
