# Mechanic: Economy, Currency & Corruption

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Complex  
**Category**: Economy / Governance

**One-line description**: Empires and factions mint currencies layered atop resource value, while black markets and corruption siphon goods, influence laws, and destabilize governance.

## Currency Systems

- **Imperial Ledger**: Baseline economy denominated in resource value (iron, plasteel, etc.).
- **Faction Currencies**: Empires/guilds mint their own credit, granting discounts or exclusive deals within controlled markets.
- **Currency Risk**: When an empire falls, its currency can crash, impacting savings and trade.
- **Cash vs Resources**: Paying in faction currency unlocks better prices; resource barter remains universal fallback.
- **Debt & Credit**: Factions can offer loans, credit lines, and bonds; default risk influences diplomacy and mission board postings.
- **Pricing Model**: Currently driven by local supply and demand; future macroeconomic layers (inflation, bubbles) deferred.

## Black Markets

- **Operations**: Underground exchange hubs trade contraband, siphon resources, and influence politician entities.
- **Law Undermining**: Bribery erodes law compliance, increasing rebellion risk.
- **Access**: Depends on corruption, tech level, and culture of the region; advanced surveillance reduces black market efficacy.

## Corruption Mechanics

- **Corruption Index**: Derived from governor integrity, tech surveillance, and cultural values.
- **Effects**: High corruption redirects resources, stalls tech diffusion, encourages black market growth.
- **Anti-Corruption**: Investments in culture, education, and tech reduce corruption, but oppressive crackdowns may backfire in morale.

## Economic Specialization

- Specialization arises when high-education workers occupy facilities long-term, leveling them into efficient conglomerates.
- Specialized colonies yield higher quality output, unlock unique tech, and attract trade—but require advanced education and governance support.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Colony Development**: Currency stability and corruption influence growth and regression.
- **Law & Rebellion**: Corruption and black markets feed rebellion stages; anti-corruption policies affect compliance.
- **Diplomacy**: Exclusive currency deals and smuggling routes impact relations.
- **Tech Progression**: Corruption can stall diffusion; specialized conglomerates drive frontier innovation.
