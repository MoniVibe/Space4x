# Mechanic: Diplomacy & Relation Dynamics

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Complex  
**Category**: Diplomacy / Social

**One-line description**: Outlook-driven affinities shape passive diplomatic drift, with ambassadors and treaties formalizing cooperation or subterfuge.

## Core Concept

Diplomacy emerges from alignment and outlook alignment between entities. Guilds, factions, empires, and the player build relations passively when they share ideals, while ideological clashes erode trust. Ambassadors act as agents that amplify or sabotage these natural drifts, unlocking treaties, trade, or covert hostility.

## Passive Relation Drift

- **Affinity Score**: Calculated from overlap in alignment triplet and ethical outlooks between two entities or aggregates.
- **Context Modifiers**: Shared threats (pirates, hostile fauna) and cooperative projects (joint mining) boost affinity; competition over resources or doctrinal clashes reduce it.
- **Aggregation**: Lower-level relationships (individuals, guilds) influence parent entities with decay factors, mirroring morale inheritance.

## Ambassadors & Diplomats

- **Assignment**: Organizations dispatch ambassador units to foreign entities. Assignment quality depends on crew traits, experience, and facility support (Embassy Modules, Cultural Archives).
- **Objectives**: Improve relations, secure trade lanes, negotiate research pacts, or intentionally sour relations (black ops, propaganda).
- **Resolution**: Ambassadors roll periodic checks influenced by morale, task alignment, and host receptiveness. Success nudges relation meters and may trigger treaty offers.

## Treaties & Agreements

- **Trade Agreements**: Enable resource exchange and passive tech diffusion.
- **Non-Aggression Pacts**: Reduce likelihood of combat engagements; doctrine alignment determines durability.
- **Research Pacts**: Synchronize tech queues per `TechProgression` guidelines.
- **Defense Accords**: Allies respond to shared threats, dispatching fleets or sharing intel.
- **Subterfuge Deals**: Devious factions may agree covert sabotage against mutual rivals.
- **Economic Treaties**: Formalize tariffs, quotas, loans, and credit lines; embargoes and sanctions throttle trade and influence relations.

## Passive Diplomacy Rules

- Outlook misalignment creates natural friction: e.g., altruistic pacifists dislike authoritarian warmongers.
- Neutral or pragmatic factions hover near 50/50 outcomes, making ambassador actions decisive.
- Migration events, trade imbalances, and tech inequities feed directly into diplomatic drift (everything is intertwined).

## Starting Mode Impact

- Starting choices define initial diplomatic standing—isolated nomads, entrenched empires, or commerce-driven guilds.
- Players may begin with allied escorts, rival debts, or neutral reputations depending on scenario selection.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Morale Dynamics**: Diplomatic victories raise morale for aligned populations; forced alliances depress incompatible groups.
- **Entity Hierarchy**: Ambassadors represent specific aggregates (guild, empire) and inherit their compliance constraints.
- **Combat Loop**: Treaty violations trigger morale hits and casus belli modifiers influencing engagement rules.
- **Tech Progression**: Trade and research pacts accelerate diffusion; embargoes stall tech flow.

## Tuning Guidance

- Keep passive drift subtle so ambassador actions and player decisions matter.
- Provide clear feedback on why relations shift (alignment mismatch, trade success, ambassador events).
- Offer doctrine or tech upgrades that specialize in diplomacy (cultural hubs, propaganda networks).
