# Mechanic: Endgame Crises & Empire Collapse

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Complex  
**Category**: Narrative / Threats

**One-line description**: Sector-spanning crises and collapse states emerge from accumulative pressures, challenging even dominant empires and reshaping the galaxy.

## Crisis Types

- **External Invasions**: Extragalactic armadas, awakened empires, or AI uprisings.
- **Environmental Cataclysms**: Stellar chain reactions, void storms, catastrophic anomalies.
- **Socio-Economic Meltdowns**: Currency collapse, supply chain implosion, famine cascades.
- **Cultural/Racial Upheavals**: Mass secessions, ideological purges, migration floods.

## Crisis Lifecycle

1. **Seeding**: Dynamic events or systemic imbalances push crisis trackers upward (corruption spikes, artifact tampering, overharvesting).
2. **Foreshadowing**: Alerts, rumors, and minor incidents telegraph the threat, giving players and AI time to prepare.
3. **Emergence**: Crisis manifests with sector-wide mechanics (e.g., invading fleets, economic debuffs, morale shocks).
4. **Escalation**: Failure to respond escalates intensity; success unlocks resolution paths.
5. **Resolution & Aftermath**: Outcomes reshape factions, borders, tech access, and morale baselines. Empires may fracture, merge, or reinvent doctrines.

## Empire Collapse Conditions

- **Civil War Victory**: Rebels seize capitals, creating successor states.
- **Conquest**: Enemy factions capture core worlds and absorb assets.
- **Cultural Replacement**: Long-term ideological conversion flips loyalty of key populations.
- **Economic Failure**: Currency crash + supply collapse forces dissolution or integration into stronger neighbors.
- **Extinction Events**: Catastrophic crises eliminate leadership or populations.

## Player Agency

- Players can steer crises—trigger early to gain advantages, or mitigate to protect trade empires.
- Owning colonies grants policy levers (martial law, refugee corridors) to influence outcomes.
- Victory is self-defined: survival, rebuilding, dominance, or simply enduring to witness the galaxy’s transformation.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Dynamic Events**: Provide narrative scaffolding and clues.
- **Tech Progression**: Certain techs unlock crisis countermeasures (shield grids, economic stabilizers).
- **Diplomacy**: Alliances shift rapidly; enemies may unite temporarily.
- **Morale & Rebellion**: Crises stress morale, accelerating rebellion or fostering unity.
