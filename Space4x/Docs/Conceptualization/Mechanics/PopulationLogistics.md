# Mechanic: Population Logistics & Migration

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Population / Logistics

**One-line description**: Civilian carriers and passenger ships move individuals and crew aggregates within systems and across stars, with migrations triggered by ethical misalignment, threats, or opportunity.

## Transport Infrastructure

- **Passenger Ships**: Shuttle individuals and crew aggregates between ships and stations within a system.
- **Light Carriers**: Handle interstellar jumps; larger warp drives required for long-range routes based on tech tier.
- **Civilian Carriers**: Dedicated to population movement, outfitted with habitat modules and low-threat defenses.

## Migration Triggers

- **Alignment Mismatch**: Prolonged ideological dissonance pushes populations to relocate.
- **Threat Level**: Imminent invasions or disasters spur mass evacuations, especially among less patriotic groups.
- **Economic Opportunity**: Rising specialized industries attract skilled workers.
- **Rebellion Pressure**: Violent rebellion vs peaceful breakoffs dictate migration scale.

## Flow Dynamics

- Migration waves scale with severity: peaceful policy disagreements produce steady trickles; existential threats produce surges.
- Empire and faction policies can incentivize or restrict migration through laws and carrier availability.
- Passenger logistics integrate with haul loop to ensure carriers have provisions for long voyages.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Morale Dynamics**: Migration events feed morale calculations for both departing and remaining populations.
- **Entity Hierarchy**: Ownership can shift when crews move carriers to new allegiances.
- **Law & Rebellion**: Forced relocation or blocked migration contributes to rebellion escalation.
- **Colony Development**: Inflows of educated migrants accelerate specialization; exodus slows growth.
