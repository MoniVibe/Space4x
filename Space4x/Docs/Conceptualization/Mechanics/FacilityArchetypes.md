# Mechanic: Facility Archetypes

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Economy / Infrastructure

**One-line description**: Facilities come in shared and host-specific archetypes, scaling from small to titanic modules depending on the entity that mounts them.

## Core Concept

Facility archetypes define how processing, fabrication, and support capabilities manifest across carriers, stations, colonies, and titan-class platforms. Some archetypes exist in every context, while others are exclusive to certain hosts. Tier scaling (Small → Titanic) applies within each archetype, adjusting throughput, crew requirements, and footprint.

## Archetype Matrix

| Archetype | Description | Carriers | Stations | Colonies | Titans/Megastructures |
|-----------|-------------|----------|----------|----------|-----------------------|
| Refinery | Converts raw ore/hydrocarbons into refined resources | Small–Massive | Small–Titanic | Small–Large | Small–Titanic |
| Fabricator | Assembles components, hull sections, construction modules | Small–Large | Small–Titanic | Small–Large | Small–Titanic |
| Foundry | Heavy metalworking for armour, frames, plasteel | Medium–Large | Medium–Titanic | Medium–Large | Medium–Titanic |
| Bioprocessor | Produces nutrients, biopolymers, life support kits | Small–Medium | Small–Massive | Small–Massive | Small–Massive |
| Research Lab | Unlocks tech upgrades, blueprint variations | Small–Medium | Small–Massive | Small–Massive | Small–Titanic |
| Logistics Hub | Enhances haul capacity, manages cargo routing | Small–Large | Small–Titanic | Small–Large | Small–Titanic |
| Titan Forge | Super-heavy fabrication (capital ships, megastructures) | — | Massive–Titanic | — | Massive–Titanic |
| Habitat Module | Increases crew/colonist comfort and retention | Small–Large | Small–Massive | Small–Titanic | Small–Titanic |

### Notes

- Carriers can field up to Massive-tier facilities with sufficient upgrades; Titanic-tier remains exclusive to large stations and titan platforms.
- Colonies focus on resource-rich archetypes (Refinery, Bioprocessor) and can develop Fabricators up to Large tier; advanced tiers require tech unlocks and planetary infrastructure support.
- Titans or megastructures unlock unique archetypes (Titan Forge) necessary for late-game construction and empire-scale projects.

## Shared vs Exclusive Modules

- **Shared**: Refinery, Fabricator, Bioprocessor, Logistics Hub, Habitat Module.
- **Carrier-Focused**: Mobile Fabrication Bays (hybrid refinery/fabricator), Expedition Labs (survey bonuses).
- **Station-Focused**: Orbital Drydocks, Trade Nexus modules, Defence Grid Control.
- **Colony-Focused**: Terraforming Plants, Civic Works, Cultural Archives.
- **Titan-Focused**: Titan Forge, Stellar Manipulators, Supercarrier Hangars.

## Development Constraints

- Hosting entity development level and tech tier govern how many facilities and which sizes can be maintained simultaneously.
- Upgrades can add additional facility slots or allow host entities to overmount one tier higher at a maintenance cost.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Construction Loop**: Facility tier and archetype feed directly into processing and build throughput.
- **Resource Chains**: Determines which recipes are available per host; colonists may monopolize certain inputs.
- **Morale Dynamics**: Habitat modules and culturally aligned facilities (e.g., Cultural Archive for xenophiles) positively influence morale when tasks match outlooks.
