# Mechanic: Maintenance & Repair Logistics

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Fleet / Logistics

**One-line description**: Carriers self-repair in hostile territory, seek shipyards in friendly space, and suffer permanent hull depletion after critical damage or repeated punishment.

## Repair Workflow

- **Hostile/Unowned Space**: Ships rely on onboard engineering to patch damage; repair speed limited by spare parts and crew fatigue.
- **Friendly Territory**: Damaged vessels route to the nearest capable shipyard or station for full refit.
- **Self-Repair Limits**: Critical hits or repeated hull stress permanently reduce max hull integrity until dockyard restoration.

## Automation Rules

- Carriers evaluate repair needs after engagements; autonomy policies determine whether to break off missions.
- AI factors stance, mission urgency, and proximity to friendly facilities when choosing repair options.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Crew Systems**: Engineering & damage control department workload spikes during field repairs.
- **Logistics Warfare**: Sustained damage without repair access can cripple fleets.
- **Command Interface**: Automation policies and alerts surface repair recommendations.
