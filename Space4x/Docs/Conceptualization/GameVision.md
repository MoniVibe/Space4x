# Space 4X - Game Vision

## Overview

Space 4X casts the player as a disembodied strategic intelligence orchestrating carrier task forces across a living galaxy. Campaigns open from distinct starting modes so players can immediately lean into trade, mining, combat, or exploration to seed empires wherever opportunity emerges.

## High-Level Vision

Deliver a carrier-first 4X where players command through orders rather than avatars, cultivating vast logistics networks that can pivot between mining, hauling, exploration, and warfare while keeping the simulation performant at extreme scale.

### Key Differentiators

- Player presence exists purely as command directives issued to carriers, stations, and construction projects.
- Starting modes are highly configurable, shifting available carriers, facility tiers, and political standing based on player-selected beginnings.
- Carrier-centric loops (mining, hauling, exploration, combat) form the foundation, with station building and colonization branching naturally from them.
- Technical ambition to sustain roughly one million active entities without sacrificing responsiveness or clarity.
- Core experience focuses on single-player today, with long-term vision to support multiplayer and shared empires.

## Target Experience

### Player Fantasy

You are the incorporeal architect of an interstellar empire, guiding carrier fleets to secure resources, defend interests, and seed civilization across unclaimed worlds—either by directly assuming control of owned carriers or by issuing RTS-style commands through the command interface.

### Core Loop

1. **Short-term** (minutes): Direct carriers to mine, scout, haul, trade, or engage nearby threats while keeping resource flows returning to stations.
2. **Mid-term** (session): Allocate hauled resources to construct stations and facilities, unlock additional carriers, and anchor footholds in promising systems. Tech progress begins cascading outward from core worlds.
3. **Long-term** (campaign): Expand reach through colonization, networked logistics, and decisive conflicts that reshape regional power balances while navigating tech diffusion lag between capitals and fringe territories.

### Pace and Scale

Strategic pacing that allows deliberate planning with bursts of action; the simulation targets responsiveness even with approximately one million active entities.

## Scope and Boundaries

### In Scope

- Multiple game modes with distinct starting conditions that shape early carrier, facility, and diplomatic configurations.
- Mining, hauling, exploration, and combat loops that interlock to fuel empire expansion and colonization.
- Station and facility construction pipelines anchored by carrier deployments.
- Threat ecosystems including space fauna, pirates, rival alien empires, and environmental phenomena that escalate over time.
- Tech progression systems that diffuse research unevenly across empires, creating temporal advantages for core worlds.

### Out of Scope

- TBD — define exclusions as additional systems come into focus.

### Future Possibilities

- TBD — capture expansion opportunities after foundational loops are specified.

## Success Criteria

### Player Engagement
- Players feel empowered to pursue any of the four core loops from their opening orders.
- Starting mode selection meaningfully alters the early-game decision space.
- Emergent goals—economic dominance, territorial stewardship, gigastructure engineering, or serene trade empires—are all supported without forcing scripted endings.

### Technical Performance
- Stable simulation and AI responsiveness at a scale of roughly one million active entities.
- Command latency stays low enough that carrier directives register immediately.

### Strategic Depth
- Core loops remain interdependent, letting players pivot strategies without losing empire momentum.
- Resource hauling between carriers and stations reveals new strategic choke points and opportunities over time.
- Dynamic events and late-game crises challenge even dominant empires, forcing adaptation rather than stagnation.
