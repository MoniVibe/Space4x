## System Overview

### Components

1. **[Component 1]:** [Role] - [Type: Actor/Resource/Rule]
2. **[Component 2]:** [Role] - [Type]

### Connections
*How do components relate?*

```
[Component A] → [Produces] → [Resource X]
[Resource X] → [Consumed by] → [Component B]
[Component B] → [Affects] → [Component A]
```

### Feedback Loops

- **Positive:** [More X → more X]
- **Negative:** [More X → less X]
- **Balance:** [Equilibrium]

---

## System Dynamics

### Inputs
*What enters the system from outside?*
- Player actions
- Environmental events
- Other systems

### Internal Processes
*What happens within the system?*
1. [Process 1]
2. [Process 2]
3. [Process 3]

### Outputs
*What the system produces/affects?*
- Game state changes
- Player rewards
- Cascading effects

---

## State Machine

### States
1. **[State]:** [Description] - Entry: [How?] - Exit: [When?]

### Transitions
```
[State A] → [Trigger] → [State B]
```

---

## Key Metrics

*Measurable properties of the system*

| Metric | Target Range | Critical Threshold |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|
| [Metric 1] | [Ideal range] | [Red flag value] |
| Example: Pop Growth | +5% per minute | < 0% (decline) |

---

## Failure Modes

- **Death Spiral:** [Cause] → [Effect] → [Recovery]
- **Stagnation:** [Cause] → [Recovery]
- **Runaway:** [Cause] → [Recovery]

---

## Player Interaction

- **Observable:** [What players see]
- **Control Points:** [Where players intervene]
- **Learning Curve:** Beginner → Intermediate → Expert

---
