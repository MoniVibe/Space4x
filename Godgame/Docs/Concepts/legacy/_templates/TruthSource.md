### Purpose
- What this spec governs and why it exists. Scope and non-goals.

### Contracts (APIs, events, invariants)
- Public APIs with signatures or links to the owning code.
- Events: name, payload, who emits, who listens.
- Invariants: conditions that must always hold true at runtime.

### Priority rules
- Where this feature sits relative to others. Reference `Interaction_Priority.md` if applicable.
- Tie-breaks, cooldowns, masks.

### Do / Don’t
- Do: practices required to stay compliant with this spec.
- Don’t: forbidden calls and patterns.

### Acceptance tests
- Table of concise tests. Each test: Given → When → Then.

### Owners
- Code owners and escalation path.
