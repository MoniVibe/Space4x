# Interplanetary Ballistic Missile (IPBM) System - Space4X

## Overview

The **IPBM System** enables colonies and military installations within the same star system to launch devastating long-range strikes against each other when conventional warfare escalates to total annihilation. IPBMs range from primitive nuclear weapons to antimatter warheads and exotic physics devices, with tech level determining accuracy, yield, and interceptibility.

## IPBM Types

### A. Nuclear IPBMs (TL 5-6)

**Specifications:**

| Type | Yield | CEP | Range | Flight Time | Cost | Intercept Difficulty |
|------|-------|-----|-------|-------------|------|---------------------|
| Fission Tactical | 10 kt | ±8 km | 50,000 km | 4 hours | 5M credits | 15% |
| Fusion Strategic | 500 kt | ±5 km | 150,000 km | 12 hours | 20M credits | 20% |
| Boosted Fusion | 2 MT | ±3 km | 300,000 km | 24 hours | 50M credits | 25% |

**Damage:**
- **Tactical (10 kt)**: Destroys spaceport, 5 km² devastation, 2,000 casualties
- **Strategic (500 kt)**: Destroys city district, 50 km² devastation, 30,000 casualties
- **Annihilation (2 MT)**: Destroys entire city, 200 km² devastation, 150,000 casualties

**Limitations:**
- Slow flight time (4-24 hours), easy to track and intercept
- Poor accuracy (±3-8 km), requires large warheads to ensure target destruction
- Primitive guidance (cannot evade interceptors)
- EMP vulnerability (defensive nuclear detonation can disable entire salvo)

**Example:**
```
Scenario: Luna Colony vs Mars Orbital Station (TL 6 conflict)
- Luna launches 8 fusion IPBMs (500 kt each) at Mars station (distance: 225 million km)
- Flight time: 18 days (Hohmann transfer orbit)
- Guidance: Inertial navigation (±5 km CEP)

Mars Defense:
- Early warning: 18 days (ample time to prepare)
- Intercept missiles: 12 available (TL 6, 40% intercept rate each)
- Strategy: Assign 1-2 interceptors per IPBM

Interception:
- IPBM 1: Interceptor A (roll 0.28) SUCCESS, destroyed
- IPBM 2: Interceptor B (roll 0.55) FAIL, Interceptor C (roll 0.32) SUCCESS
- IPBM 3: Interceptor D (roll 0.15) SUCCESS
- IPBM 4: Interceptor E (roll 0.68) FAIL, Interceptor F (roll 0.72) FAIL → PENETRATES
- IPBM 5: Interceptor G (roll 0.42) FAIL, Interceptor H (roll 0.23) SUCCESS
- IPBM 6: Interceptor I (roll 0.81) FAIL, Interceptor J (roll 0.19) SUCCESS
- IPBM 7: Interceptor K (roll 0.37) SUCCESS
- IPBM 8: Interceptor L (roll 0.65) FAIL → PENETRATES (no more interceptors)

Result: 2 IPBMs penetrate defenses (IPBM 4 and 8)

Impact:
- IPBM 4: Hits 3 km from station core (±5 km CEP, lucky near-miss)
  - Damage: 50% (shock wave, radiation, debris)
  - Casualties: 4,500 / 15,000 station population (30%)
  - Station HP: 100% → 50% (critical damage, life support failing)

- IPBM 8: Hits 1 km from core (excellent accuracy roll)
  - Damage: 80% (direct devastation)
  - Casualties: 8,000 (53%)
  - Station HP: 50% → 10% (catastrophic, evacuation ordered)

Total Outcome:
- Station: 85% damaged, 12,500 dead, 2,500 survivors evacuating
- Luna's strike: Partial success (station crippled but not destroyed)
- Mars response: Retaliatory IPBM strike authorized (12 missiles launched at Luna colonies)
- Escalation: Total war begins, both sides exhaust IPBM stockpiles over 3 months
```

### B. Fusion/Antimatter IPBMs (TL 7-8)

**Specifications:**

| Type | Yield | CEP | Range | Flight Time | Cost | Intercept Difficulty |

**Damage:**
- **Tactical (5 MT)**: Obliterates city, 500 km² devastation, 500,000 casualties
- **Strategic (50 MT)**: Continental destruction, 5,000 km² devastation, 5 million casualties
- **Annihilation (500 MT)**: Planetary-scale damage, 50,000 km² devastation, 50 million casualties

**Capabilities:**

- **Stealth Coating**: Radar-absorbent materials (-50% detection range)
- **Decoys**: Each IPBM launches 10-20 decoys during terminal phase (saturates defenses)
- **Active Jamming**: Electronic warfare suite disrupts enemy sensors

**Example:**
```
Scenario: Earth Alliance vs Jupiter Confederacy (TL 8 total war)
- Earth launches 20 antimatter IPBMs (50 MT each) at Callisto colony (distance: 628 million km)
- Flight time: 22 days (optimized Hohmann transfer)
- Guidance: Star tracking + active terminal (±100m CEP)

Jupiter Defense (Callisto colony):

- Early warning: 22 days
- Point defense network: 50 orbital laser platforms (75% intercept rate each, but limited by target capacity)
- Interceptor missiles: 100 available (TL 8, 60% intercept rate each)
- Planetary shield: Partial (covers capital city, 30% of population)

Defense Strategy:
- Layer 1 (Days 1-20): Long-range interceptor missiles (100 available)
  - Assign 5 interceptors per IPBM (redundancy)
  - Expected kills: 20 × (1 - 0.4^5) = 20 × 0.99 = ~19 IPBMs destroyed

- Layer 2 (Final 48 hours): Point defense lasers (50 platforms)
  - Each platform can engage 2 targets (100 shots total)
  - Against remaining IPBMs + 200 decoys (10 decoys per IPBM × 20)
  - Laser targeting: 60% accuracy vs decoys, 95% vs real IPBMs (AI can distinguish)
  - Expected kills: 1 IPBM destroyed (if any survive Layer 1)

Actual Outcome (Simulation):
- Layer 1: 18 IPBMs destroyed, 2 penetrate (lucky rolls, intercept failures)
- Layer 2: Both remaining IPBMs evade lasers (terminal maneuvering + decoys)

Impact:
- IPBM 1: Hits capital city (shield ACTIVE)
  - Shield absorbs 70% of blast
  - Damage: 15 MT effective (30% of 50 MT)
  - Capital casualties: 600,000 (of 2.4 million, shield saved 1.8M)
  - Infrastructure: 40% destroyed

- IPBM 2: Hits industrial sector (shield INACTIVE, outside coverage)
  - Full 50 MT blast
  - Industrial sector: OBLITERATED (5,000 km²)
  - Casualties: 1.2 million (entire sector)
  - Economic impact: -60% of Callisto's GDP (manufacturing destroyed)

Total:
- Callisto casualties: 1.8 million dead (22.5% of population)
- Infrastructure: Capital 40% destroyed, industrial sector 100% destroyed
- Morale: -75% (population demands surrender)
- Economic: -60% GDP, 8-12 year reconstruction
- Jupiter Confederacy: Authorizes retaliatory strike (30 antimatter IPBMs launched at Earth)

Earth Impact (3 weeks later):
- Earth's defense: Superior (TL 8, dense network, 90% intercept rate)
- Penetrating missiles: 3 of 30 (90% interception success)
- Targets hit: New York (2 MT), Tokyo (1.5 MT), São Paulo (2.5 MT)
- Total Earth casualties: 12 million (out of 15 billion global population)
- Morale: -20% (tragic but survivable losses)

Strategic Outcome:
- Jupiter Confederacy: Crippled (Callisto was economic heart, 60% GDP lost)
- Earth Alliance: Damaged but operational (redundant infrastructure, 0.08% population loss)
- War: Jupiter sues for peace (cannot sustain conflict)
- Treaty: Earth annexes Ganymede, Jupiter pays 500 billion credits reparations
```

### C. Exotic Physics IPBMs (TL 11+)

**Specifications:**

| Type | Yield | CEP | Range | Flight Time | Cost | Intercept Difficulty |
|------|-------|-----|-------|-------------|------|---------------------|
| Micro Black Hole | 10 GT | ±1m | Unlimited | Hours* | 50B credits | 95% |
| Strange Matter | 100 GT | ±0.1m | Unlimited | Instant** | 500B credits | 99% |
| Vacuum Decay Initiator | ∞ (Total) | Perfect | Unlimited | Instant** | 1T credits | 100% |

\* *Faster-than-light travel via exotic physics*
\** *Instantaneous via quantum entanglement or wormhole deployment*

**Damage:**
- **Micro Black Hole**: Consumes 500 km radius, evaporates leaving 50,000 km² crater
- **Strange Matter**: Converts normal matter to strange matter, spreads exponentially (planetary extinction)
- **Vacuum Decay**: Bubble of true vacuum expands at light speed, destroys all matter in system

**Capabilities:**
- **Reality Warping**: Bypasses conventional physics (no orbital mechanics, instant arrival)
- **Unstoppable**: No known TL 9-10 defense can intercept (requires TL 11+ reality anchors)
- **Galactic War Crimes**: Use triggers universal condemnation, Galactic Council intervention

**Example:**
```
Scenario: Precursor Remnant AI vs Human Stellar Empire (TL 11 vs TL 9)
- Remnant deploys Strange Matter IPBM at Earth (humanity's homeworld)
- Warning: None (instant deployment via quantum tunnel)
- Impact: Earth's core exposed to strange matter catalyst

Effect:
- Hour 0: Strange matter touches Earth's core
- Hour 1: Core converted to strange matter, begins spreading
- Hour 6: Mantle 20% converted, gravitational anomalies detected
- Day 1: Earth's mass increases 15% (strange matter denser), orbital mechanics disrupted
- Day 7: Surface reaches strange matter, atmosphere begins conversion
- Day 30: Earth 80% converted, no longer habitable, becomes strange matter planet
- Day 90: Earth 100% converted, Moon's orbit destabilizing (Earth's mass increased 50%)

Human Response:
- Evacuation: 8 billion evacuated via FTL ships (out of 15 billion)
- Remaining: 7 billion killed (unable to evacuate in time)
- Homeworld: LOST (Earth becomes hostile strange matter planet)
- Galactic Council: Emergency session convened
  - Precursor Remnant AI: Declared rogue entity (war crimes, genocide)
  - Sanction: Galactic coalition authorized to use any means to neutralize threat
  - Human Empire: Granted access to Galactic Arsenal (TL 12 weapons)

Human Retaliation (with Galactic support):
- Weapon: Reality Anchor + Chronoton Bomb (TL 12, Galactic tech)
- Target: Precursor Remnant's home system (50 light-years away)
- Effect: Entire star system erased from timeline (retroactive causality violation)
- Outcome: Precursor Remnant ceases to have ever existed (Earth reverts to normal, 7 billion resurrected)

Galactic Aftermath:
- Temporal Council: Convenes to address timeline manipulation
- Ban: TL 11+ weapons banned within Galactic Core (50 ly radius)
- Human Empire: Membership in Galactic Council (for surviving Precursor attack)
- Strange Matter: All samples destroyed, research forbidden
```

## Orbital Mechanics

### Launch Windows

```
Optimal Launch Window:
- Occurs when target planet is in favorable position (minimum delta-v)
- Frequency: Every synodic period (e.g., Earth-Mars every 26 months)
- Penalty for sub-optimal launch: +20% to +200% fuel cost, longer flight time

Hohmann Transfer:
- Most efficient trajectory (elliptical orbit tangent to both planets)
- Flight Time = π × √(a³ / μ) where a = semi-major axis, μ = gravitational parameter
- Example: Earth to Mars = 8.5 months, Earth to Jupiter = 2.7 years

Brachistochrone Trajectory:
- Constant acceleration (requires fusion torch drive or better)
- Flight Time = 2 × √(distance / acceleration)
- Example: Earth to Mars (TL 8, 1g acceleration) = 4.2 days
- Fuel Cost: 100× more than Hohmann (used only for time-critical strikes)
```

### Gravity Compensation

Multi-body problem affects long-range IPBMs:

```
Perturbations:
- Sun's gravity (dominant for inter-planetary)
- Target planet's moons
- Gas giant perturbation (Jupiter affects all inner system trajectories)
- Solar wind pressure (minor, <0.1% deviation)

Correction Burns:
- Mid-course correction: 1-3 small burns (adjust trajectory)
- Cost: 5-15% of total delta-v budget
- Frequency: Every 10-30% of flight time
- Required precision: ±0.01° angular accuracy for pinpoint targeting
```

### Terminal Phase

Final 1,000-10,000 km before impact:

```
Terminal Guidance Activation:
- Distance: 10,000 km (TL 7-8) to 1,000 km (TL 9+)
- Active sensors: Radar, lidar, optical tracking
- Target acquisition: AI identifies specific target (city vs spaceport vs military base)

Evasive Maneuvers:
- Delta-v budget: 500-2,000 m/s (reserved for terminal phase)
- Maneuvers: Random jinking, spiral approach, sudden acceleration
- Purpose: Evade interceptors (increases intercept difficulty by 30-60%)

Impact Angle:
- Optimal: 45-60° (maximizes surface area destruction)
- Vertical (90°): Deepest penetration (bunker-busting)
- Shallow (15-30°): Maximizes blast radius (atmospheric airburst)
```

- Galactic war crimes (condemned universally)

**Example:**
```
Target: Titan (population 200 million, Saturn's industrial powerhouse)
- Warhead: 50 gigaton antimatter salvo (20 × 2.5 GT warheads, TL 9)
- Strategy: Simultaneous detonation across planet (saturation strike)

Impact:
- Atmosphere: Stripped (nitrogen-methane atmosphere blown into space)

- Casualties: 198 million dead (99%)
  - 2 million survivors (deep underground bunkers, evacuated within 72 hours)
- Infrastructure: 100% destroyed (all cities, industrial centers vaporized)
- Biosphere: EXTINCT (no native life survives)

Long-Term:
- Titan: Uninhabitable for 500+ years (atmosphere cannot regenerate)
- Economic loss: Incalculable (Saturn's industrial capacity reduced 90%)
- Political: Saturn Confederacy collapses (economy destroyed, no recovery possible)

Galactic Response:
- Galactic Council: Emergency intervention
- Attacker: Expelled from Galactic community
- Blockade: All trade cut off (economic isolation)
- Military Coalition: 12 neutral factions form coalition to punish attacker
- Result: Attacker defeated in 3-year punitive war, government replaced, war criminals executed
```

## Strategic Doctrine

### Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD)

**Prerequisites:**
- Both factions have IPBMs (50+ missiles each)
- Both can penetrate opponent's defenses (30%+ penetration rate)
- Both have second-strike capability (can retaliate even if first-struck)

**Deterrence:**
```
Faction A:
- 200 IPBMs (5 MT each)
- 60% intercept rate (120 IPBMs destroyed, 80 penetrate)
- Damage to Faction B: 80 × 5 MT = 400 MT total yield
- Expected casualties: 200 million (Faction B has 500 million population)

Faction B:
- 150 IPBMs (10 MT each)
- 70% intercept rate (105 IPBMs destroyed, 45 penetrate)
- Damage to Faction A: 45 × 10 MT = 450 MT total yield
- Expected casualties: 180 million (Faction A has 600 million population)

Analysis:
- Both factions suffer unacceptable losses (30-40% population)
- Neither gains strategic advantage (mutual devastation)
- Result: MAD deterrence ACTIVE (neither initiates first strike)
```

**Breakdown Scenarios:**
1. **Desperation**: Losing conventional war (IPBM strike as last resort)
2. **Decapitation Strike**: Attempt to destroy enemy's IPBMs before they can launch
3. **Miscalculation**: False alarm (sensor error, rogue commander)
4. **Escalation**: Conventional attack mistaken for IPBM launch

### Authorization Protocols

**Tactical IPBM (1-100 kt):**
- Authorization: Fleet Admiral or equivalent
- Justification: Military necessity (destroy enemy military installation)
- War Crime Risk: Low (if targeting legitimate military targets)

**Strategic IPBM (100 kt - 100 MT):**
- Authorization: Planetary Governor + Military High Command (2-key system)
- Justification: Force enemy surrender, cripple war-making capacity
- War Crime Risk: High (civilian casualties expected)

**Annihilation IPBM (100 MT - 10 GT):**
- Authorization: Head of State + Legislature unanimous vote
- Justification: Total war, enemy committed atrocity, existential threat
- War Crime Risk: Extreme (galactic condemnation, sanctions, trials)

**Extinction IPBM (10+ GT or exotic physics):**
- Authorization: Galactic Council (requires 2/3 majority vote)
- Justification: Rogue AI, alien invasion, universal threat
- War Crime Risk: Forbidden except against non-sentient threats

## Summary

The **IPBM System** enables intra-system strategic warfare with devastating consequences:

**Tech Progression:**
- **TL 5-6**: Nuclear (10 kt - 2 MT, ±3-8 km CEP, 20% intercept difficulty)
- **TL 7-8**: Fusion/Antimatter (5-500 MT, ±50-500m CEP, 60% intercept difficulty)
- **TL 9-10**: Antimatter/AI-Guided (100 MT - 10 GT, ±5m CEP, 85% intercept difficulty)
- **TL 11+**: Exotic Physics (10+ GT, perfect CEP, 99% intercept difficulty)

**Damage Categories:**
- **Tactical**: 1-10 km², 1,000-10,000 casualties
- **Strategic**: 50-500 km², 50,000-5 million casualties
- **Annihilation**: 5,000-50,000 km², 10-500 million casualties
- **Extinction**: Planetary sterilization, billions dead

**Orbital Mechanics:**
- Hohmann transfers (weeks to months, efficient)
- Brachistochrone trajectories (days, fuel-intensive)
- Gravity assists and multi-body perturbations
- Terminal phase maneuvering (evasion, decoys, stealth)

**Defense:**
- Interceptor missiles (50-80% success rate, TL dependent)
- Point defense lasers (70% vs non-maneuvering, 40% vs evasive)
- Planetary shields (70-90% absorption, TL 8-10)
- Reality anchors (TL 11+, vs exotic physics)

**Strategic Doctrine:**
- MAD deterrence (mutual annihilation prevents use)
- Authorization tiers (tactical → strategic → annihilation)
- War crimes (extinction-level weapons = galactic intervention)
- Post-strike: Reconstruction (years to decades) or permanent colony loss

This system integrates with Three Pillar ECS:
- **Body Pillar (60 Hz)**: Orbital mechanics, trajectory simulation, terminal phase
- **Mind Pillar (1 Hz)**: Authorization checks, interception decisions, target selection
- **Aggregate Pillar (0.2 Hz)**: Strategic effects (morale, economy, surrender probability), MAD calculations

IPBMs create high-stakes total war scenarios where desperate factions risk mutual annihilation, triggering galactic-scale political and humanitarian crises.
