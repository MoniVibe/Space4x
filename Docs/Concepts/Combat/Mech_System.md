# Mech System - Space4X

## Overview

In Space4X, mechs are advanced bipedal war machines ranging from agile scouts to massive assault platforms. Each mech consists of a chassis (frame) that houses modules (weapons, armor, systems) which can be enhanced with addons (targeting computers, ammo feeds, heat sinks). Mechs vary in size class, tech level, quality, and rarity, and are piloted through neural interfaces by single pilots, dual crews, AI-assisted systems, or remote swarm operators.

**Piloting Configurations:**
- **Solo Neural**: Single pilot with direct neural link
- **Dual Crew**: Pilot + Gunner/Engineer for heavy mechs
- **AI Co-Pilot**: Human pilot + onboard AI assistant
- **Remote Swarm**: Single operator commands 5-20 mechs via quantum link

- HP: 2,500 × 1.6 (Elite) × 1.35 (Custom) = **5,400 HP**
- Speed: 25 × 1.6 × 1.35 = **54 m/s**
- Weapon: Experimental 40mm autocannon (180 × 2.2 = **396 damage/round**, 1,500 rpm)
- Active Camo: 85% stealth
- Jump Jets: 80m vertical leaps
- Pilot: Ace (skill 18, +144% combat effectiveness, 92% neural sync = +30% stats)

**Effective Stats with Pilot:**
- HP: 5,400 × 1.3 = **7,020 HP**
- Speed: 54 × 1.3 = **70 m/s**
- Damage: 396 × 1.44 = **571 damage/round**
- DPS: 571 × 25 rds/sec = **14,275 DPS**

**Combatant 2**: "Shadow" - Standard Mass-Produced Scout
- HP: 2,500
- Speed: 25 m/s
- Weapon: Standard 30mm autocannon (120 damage, 900 rpm)
- Active Camo: 60% stealth
- Pilot: Veteran (skill 10, +80% effectiveness)

**Effective Stats:**
- HP: 2,500 × 1.0 = **2,500 HP**
- Damage: 120 × 1.8 = **216 damage/round**
- DPS: 216 × 15 rds/sec = **3,240 DPS**

**Engagement:**
1. Both mechs activate camo, approach at 500m
2. Phantom's sensors (TL 10) detect Shadow at 450m (Shadow's 60% stealth insufficient)
3. Shadow cannot detect Phantom (85% stealth defeats TL 8 sensors)
4. Phantom opens fire at 350m, 2-second burst: 14,275 × 2 = **28,550 damage**
5. Shadow's HP: 2,500 - 28,550 = **destroyed instantly**
6. Phantom victory in 3 seconds (detection + positioning + fire)

### Scenario 2: Heavy Assault Mech vs Fortified Position

**Attacker**: "Warhammer" - Military-Grade Assault Mech
- HP: 15,000 × 1.3 = **19,500 HP**
- Armor: 100 × 1.3 = **130 armor**
- Shields: 3,000 HP × 2 generators = **6,000 HP**
- Weapons:
  - 2× Railguns: 2,600 damage each, 1.5 sec cooldown
  - 2× Missile Launchers: 20 missiles × 700 damage = 14,000 damage per volley

**Defender**: Fortified Bunker
- Structural HP: 50,000
- Armor: 200
- Defense: 2× Auto-turrets (500 DPS each), minefield (5,000 damage if triggered)

**Engagement:**
1. Warhammer advances at 12 m/s, 800m from bunker
2. Minefield triggers at 200m: 5,000 damage - 130 armor = **4,870 damage to shields** (shields: 1,130 HP remaining)
3. Turrets open fire: 500 DPS × 2 = 1,000 DPS (depletes shields in 1.13 seconds)
4. Warhammer fires missiles (14,000 damage) at bunker: 14,000 - 200 armor = **13,800 damage** (bunker: 36,200 HP)
5. Warhammer fires railguns (2 shots): (2,600 - 200) × 2 = **4,800 damage** (bunker: 31,400 HP)
6. Shields depleted, turrets hit mech: 1,000 DPS - 130 armor = **870 DPS** (HP: 18,630 after 1 sec)
7. Second missile volley: **13,800 damage** (bunker: 17,600 HP)
8. Continuous fire for 8 more seconds:
   - Railguns: (2,400 × 2) × 4 shots = **19,200 damage**
   - Bunker HP: 17,600 - 19,200 = **-1,600 (destroyed)**
9. Mech HP remaining: 18,630 - (870 × 8) = **11,670 HP** (60% HP remaining)

**Result**: Warhammer destroys bunker in 15 seconds, takes 40% damage

### Scenario 3: Swarm Engagement

**Swarm**: 12 Light Mechs (Remote Control, 40% efficiency each)
- Individual HP: 2,500 × 0.4 = **1,000 HP each**
- Individual damage: 120 × 0.4 = **48 damage** (autocannon)
- DPS per mech: 48 × 15 rds/sec = **720 DPS**
- Total swarm DPS: 720 × 12 = **8,640 DPS**

**Tactic**: Wolfpack (surround target, +40% armor pen)
- Effective DPS: 8,640 × 1.4 = **12,096 DPS**

**Opponent**: Elite Heavy Mech "Colossus"
- HP: 15,000 × 1.6 = **24,000 HP**
- Armor: 100 × 1.6 = **160 armor**
- Shields: 7,500 HP
- Weapons: 4× Heavy weapons (2,000 damage each, AoE capable)
- Point Defense: CIWS (destroys 1 light mech per 3 seconds)

**Engagement:**
1. Swarm surrounds Colossus at 500m, Wolfpack formation active
2. Colossus fires AoE weapon: 2,000 damage hits 3 mechs in blast → **3 mechs destroyed**
3. Remaining swarm (9 mechs): 720 × 9 × 1.4 = **9,072 DPS**
4. Swarm fires on shields: 9,072 DPS depletes 7,500 HP in **0.83 seconds**
5. Colossus fires second AoE: **2 more mechs destroyed** (7 remaining)
6. Swarm DPS: 720 × 7 × 1.4 = **7,056 DPS**
7. CIWS destroys 1 mech every 3 sec (6 remaining after 3 sec)
8. Damage to Colossus over 3 seconds: (7,056 - 160 armor) × 3 = **20,688 damage**
9. Colossus HP: 24,000 - 20,688 = **3,312 HP** (critical)
10. Colossus fires remaining weapons, destroys **3 mechs** (3 swarm remaining)
11. Final swarm volley: (720 × 3 × 1.4 - 160) × 1 sec = **2,848 damage**
12. Colossus HP: 3,312 - 2,848 = **464 HP (survives)**
13. Colossus destroys final 3 mechs over next 5 seconds

**Result**: Colossus survives with 2% HP, swarm annihilated
**Cost Analysis**: 12 Light Mechs (30M credits) vs 1 Elite Heavy (40M credits) - **Pyrrhic victory**

## Conclusion

Space4X mechs represent the evolution of ground warfare, combining devastating firepower with tactical mobility. From nimble scouts to towering titans, mechs dominate the battlefield through superior technology, skilled pilots, and strategic loadouts. Whether piloted solo through neural link, coordinated by veteran crews, assisted by quantum AI, or commanded in swarms, mechs are the ultimate expression of combined arms warfare in the distant future.
