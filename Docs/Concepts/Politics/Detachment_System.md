# Detachment System - Space4X

## Overview

Large fleets, corporations, and military formations can temporarily detach smaller task forces to perform specialized missions while the parent formation continues its primary objective. **Detachments** (space equivalent of sub-bands) operate semi-independently with specific missions: reconnaissance, resource collection, supply runs, strike operations, diplomatic envoys, and rear-guard actions. Detachments communicate via FTL comms, quantum entanglement, or relay buoys, and rejoin at designated coordinates or continue as independent units.

**Core Systems:**
- **Parent Formation**: Main fleet, corporation, or military force
- **Detachment**: Smaller task force with specialized mission
- **FTL Communication**: Instantaneous coordination over light-years
- **Quantum Nav-Beacons**: Fixed rendezvous points in space
- **Independent Operations**: Detachments may evolve into autonomous entities

## Detachment Formation

### Decision Matrix

Fleet commanders form detachments based on:

```
Detachment Value = (Expected Benefit × Success Probability) - (Cost + Risk Penalty)

Scout Flotilla:
- Benefit: Prevent ambush (saves 200M credits in fleet damage)
- Success probability: 75%
- Cost: 6 ships (60M credits), 15 days
- Risk: 20% chance of total loss (60M credits)
- Value: (200M × 0.75) - (60M + 12M) = 150M - 72M = +78M → Form detachment ✓

Mining Convoy:
- Benefit: 30,000 tons raw materials (120M credits value)
- Success probability: 65%
- Cost: 15 ships (90M credits), 12 days, pirate risk
- Risk: 35% chance of 50% loss (45M credits)
- Value: (120M × 0.65) - (90M + 15.75M) = 78M - 105.75M = -27.75M → Do not form ✗
```

---

### Ship Selection

Detachments require ships with appropriate capabilities:

**Scout Flotilla (optimal 6 ships):**
1. Scout Frigate (Sensors TL 9, 200 crew) - Leader, long-range detection
2. Scout Frigate (Sensors TL 9, 200 crew) - Redundancy
3. Interceptor (Speed 0.35c, 50 crew) - Fast response, dogfighting
4. Interceptor (Speed 0.35c, 50 crew)
5. Stealth Corvette (Active camo 92%, 80 crew) - Penetrate enemy territory
6. Science Vessel (Lab modules, 150 crew) - Analyze anomalies, first contact

**Total crew**: 730 (from parent fleet of 15,000)
**Fleet strength impact**: -4.9% (minimal)

**Skill Synergies:**
- Scout + Interceptor: +25% threat response time (early warning + fast intercept)
- Science Vessel + Scout: +30% anomaly identification (detailed analysis)
- Stealth + Interceptor: +20% evasion (scout ahead, interceptors follow safe path)

---

### Resource Allocation

**Scout Flotilla (6 ships, 21 day mission):**
- Fuel: 3,000 tons (500 tons per ship, safety margin included)
- Food: 1,500 rations (730 crew × 21 days + 20% safety margin)
- Ammunition: 120 missiles (20 per combat ship)
- Spare parts: 50 tons (emergency repairs)
- Credits: 500,000 (bribes, emergency purchases, docking fees)
- **Total logistics footprint**: 3,550 tons + 500k credits

**Resupply Convoy (30 ships, 45 day mission):**
- Fuel: 80,000 tons (travel to depot and back)
- Food: 22,500 rations (fleet crew + convoy crew)
- Purchase budget: 150 million credits (buy supplies at depot)
- Cargo capacity: 150,000 tons (bring back supplies)
- **Return cargo**: 50,000 tons fuel, 50,000 tons raw materials, 30,000 tons ammunition, 20,000 tons food

## Communication Systems

### FTL Communication

**Quantum Entanglement Comm (TL 9+)**:
- Range: Unlimited (instant across galaxy)
- Bandwidth: 10 GB/sec (video, sensor data, orders)
- Reliability: 99.8%
- Cost: 50 million credits per paired module
- Power: 500 MW

**Tachyon Burst Transmitter (TL 7-8)**:
- Range: 100 light-years
- Bandwidth: 100 MB/sec (text, compressed data)
- Reliability: 95%
- Latency: 1-10 minutes (tachyon travel time)
- Cost: 10 million credits
- Power: 200 MW

**Relay Buoy Network (TL 6+)**:
- Range: 5 light-years per buoy
- Bandwidth: 50 MB/sec
- Reliability: 90% (buoys can be destroyed/malfunction)
- Cost: 5 million credits per buoy
- Deployment: Leave buoys as breadcrumbs, detachment follows path back

---

### Autonomy Levels

**Tethered (Low Autonomy)**:
- Detachment reports every 2-6 hours
- Cannot deviate from mission without approval
- Parent can recall instantly via FTL comms
- **Use**: High-value detachments (diplomatic missions, strike forces carrying classified tech)

**Semi-Autonomous (Medium Autonomy)**:
- Detachment reports every 12-24 hours
- Can make tactical decisions within mission scope
- Parent can request recall (detachment complies within 24 hours)
- **Use**: Scout flotillas, mining convoys, resupply runs

**Independent (High Autonomy)**:
- Detachment reports every 3-7 days
- Full tactical and strategic authority
- Parent can only request return (detachment may refuse)
- **Use**: Long-range exploration, deep-strike missions, diplomatic envoys to distant civilizations

---

## Rendezvous Mechanics

### Quantum Nav-Beacon System

**Fixed Rendezvous:**
- Parent fleet places Quantum Nav-Beacon at coordinates (e.g., Delta Sector, 23.5 ly from start point)
- Beacon broadcasts homing signal (5 light-year range, quantum-encrypted)
- Detachment follows signal back to parent
- **Success rate**: 98% (beacon malfunction 2%)

**Mobile Rendezvous:**
- Parent fleet leaves breadcrumb relay buoys along FTL jump path
- Detachment tracks buoy network back to parent
- **Success rate**: 85-95% (depends on buoy reliability, enemy interference)

**Timed Rendezvous:**
- Parent and detachment agree on coordinates + time (e.g., "Gamma Station, Day 45, 18:00 GMT")
- Both navigate independently to location
- **Success rate**: 90% (FTL nav errors, timing delays)

---

### Rejoining Process

**1. Signal Acquisition (Detachment locates parent)**
- Quantum beacon: Instant lock, 5 ly range
- Tachyon ping: 1-10 minute search, 100 ly range
- Visual search: 0.01 ly range (useless in deep space)

**2. Approach Vector (Detachment closes distance)**
- FTL jump to within 0.1 ly
- Sublight burn (0.1c → 0.01c) to avoid collision
- Docking approach (final 10 km, matching velocity)

**3. Data Transfer (Intelligence upload)**
- Scout flotilla: Sensor logs (500 GB), star charts, threat assessments
- Mining convoy: Resource surveys, claim coordinates
- Resupply convoy: Depot status, prices, political intel
- Strike force: Battle damage assessment, enemy casualties, captured data

**4. Resource Transfer**
- Mining convoy: Offload 30,000 tons raw materials (6 hour transfer)
- Resupply convoy: Offload 150,000 tons supplies (18 hour transfer)
- Strike force: Transfer prisoners (200 POWs), salvaged tech

**5. Personnel Reintegration**
- Casualties: 15% (strike force lost 12 ships, 180 crew KIA)
- Wounded: 120 crew (transferred to parent fleet hospital)
- Promotions: Strike force commander promoted to Commodore (+20 rep)
- Shore leave: Surviving crews granted 48 hour R&R (morale boost)

---

## Independent Detachments

### Conditions for Independence

**Voluntary Separation:**
- Detachment completes mission, decides not to rejoin
- Reasons: Founded lucrative mining operation, defected to enemy, ideological split
- **Example**: Mining convoy discovers ultra-rich asteroid field, establishes independent mining corporation

**Forced Separation:**
- Parent fleet destroyed in battle
- Detachment too far away to help (50+ light-years)
- Detachment orphaned, must survive independently

**Mutual Agreement:**
- Parent and detachment agree to separate
- **Example**: Diplomatic mission establishes embassy on alien world permanently
- **Example**: Scout flotilla becomes independent exploration guild

---

### Evolution Examples

**Scout Flotilla → Exploration Guild:**
- Original: 6 ships detached from 8th Fleet
- Post-independence: Recruit to 20 ships, establish HQ at frontier starbase
- New identity: "Pathfinder's League" exploration guild
- Services: Sell star charts (500k-2M credits), guide colonists, survey for corporations
- Relations with parent: Allied (65), will provide intel for payment

**Mining Convoy → Mining Corporation:**
- Original: 15 ships detached from Terran Federation Fleet
- Post-independence: Secure exclusive mining rights to rich system
- New identity: "Helix Mining Consortium"
- Growth: Expand to 50 mining barges, 8 refineries, 20 escort ships
- Revenue: 200M credits/year
- Relations with parent: Trade partners (70), pay licensing fees

**Strike Force → Mercenary Company:**
- Original: 30 ships detached for deep-strike mission
- Post-independence: Parent fleet destroyed, strike force orphaned
- New identity: "Black Star Privateers"
- Services: Sell military services (5-20M credits per contract)
- Composition: 45 ships (recruited survivors from other battles)
- Reputation: Ruthless but effective (+40 combat rep, -20 diplomatic rep)

## Detachment Combat Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Scout Flotilla Ambush

**Setup:**
- **Detachment**: Scout Flotilla "Eagle Eye" (6 ships, 730 crew)
- **Mission**: Scout 15 light-years ahead of parent fleet
- **Enemy**: Pirate Ambush (8 corvettes, 2 frigates)

**Engagement:**

**T=0 hours: Detection**
Scout Frigate detects pirate formation at 8 light-minutes (sensor range):
- Enemy strength: 10 ships, medium threat
- Detachment outgunned but faster
- Decision: Evade and report, or engage?

**T=5 minutes: Commander Decision**
Scout Commander (Captain Reyes) chooses to evade:
- Stealth Corvette activates cloaking (92% stealth)
- Interceptors perform high-G burn (8G acceleration, crew in G-suits)
- Science Vessel protected in center of formation

**T=12 minutes: Pirate Pursuit**
Pirates detect interceptors, pursue at 4G:
- Interceptor max speed: 0.35c
- Pirate max speed: 0.25c
- **Gap widens**: Interceptors outrun pirates in 20 minutes

**T=18 minutes: FTL Comm to Parent**
Scout Flotilla sends encrypted FTL message:
- "Pirate formation, 10 ships, coordinates X-42-Y-18-Z-03, evaded successfully"
- Parent fleet adjusts course to avoid ambush
- **Mission success**: Parent avoids 2 billion credit fleet engagement

**Result**: Scout flotilla 0 casualties, mission success, parent fleet saved

---

### Scenario 2: Mining Convoy Under Attack

**Setup:**
- **Detachment**: Mining Convoy "Ore Hauler Group 7" (18 ships: 10 barges, 6 escorts, 1 refinery, 1 tender)
- **Mission**: Extract 40,000 tons ice + metals from asteroid belt
- **Enemy**: Pirate Fleet (12 attack frigates, 1 carrier with 30 fighters)

**Engagement:**

**Day 8: Mining Operations (50% cargo full)**
Convoy has 20,000 tons loaded, still mining:
- 8 barges actively extracting
- 2 barges returning to refinery
- 6 escorts on patrol (3 near barges, 3 at perimeter)

**Day 8, 14:30: Pirate Attack**
Pirate fleet emerges from FTL 2 light-minutes away:
- Fighters launch immediately (30 fighters, 0.4c intercept speed)
- Frigates close at 0.2c
- Estimated contact: 8 minutes

**Day 8, 14:32: Emergency Broadcast**
Convoy commander orders:
- All barges: Disengage mining, full burn to refinery ship (rally point)
- Escorts: Intercept fighter screen (3 escorts vs 30 fighters, hopeless but necessary)
- Refinery + Tender: Begin FTL spool (10 minute warm-up)

**Day 8, 14:38: Fighter Engagement**
3 escort frigates engage 30 fighters:
- Escort CIWS (autocannons): Destroy 8 fighters in first pass
- Remaining 22 fighters: Overwhelm escorts with missiles
- Result: 2 escorts destroyed, 1 heavily damaged (retreating), 8 fighters down

**Day 8, 14:40: Main Pirate Fleet Arrives**
12 pirate frigates close to 50,000 km:
- Target: Mining barges (slow, defenseless, valuable cargo)
- 4 barges caught before reaching refinery
- Pirates board barges, take 8,000 tons cargo + barge crews hostage (320 crew)

**Day 8, 14:44: Convoy FTL Escape**
Refinery + Tender + 6 barges + 1 damaged escort jump to FTL:
- Escaped with: 12,000 tons cargo (30% of target)
- Lost: 4 barges (8,000 tons cargo), 2 escorts, 480 crew (320 captured, 160 KIA)
- **Casualty rate**: 30% ships, 27% crew

**Day 8, 16:00: Rendezvous with Parent Fleet**
Convoy rejoins parent 3 light-years away:
- Reports pirate attack, requests rescue mission for hostages
- Parent fleet dispatches strike force to negotiate ransom

**Outcome:**
- Cargo delivered: 12,000 tons (failed to meet 40,000 ton target)
- Cost: 4 mining barges (200M credits), 2 escorts (150M credits), 480 crew (ransom: 10M credits)
- **Total loss**: 360M credits vs 480M expected revenue → **Net loss of -160M**
- Lesson: Insufficient escort strength for hostile sector

---

### Scenario 3: Strike Force Deep Penetration

**Setup:**
- **Detachment**: Strike Force "Warhammer" (28 ships: 1 battlecruiser, 20 frigates, 5 stealth bombers, 2 ECM ships)
- **Mission**: Destroy enemy shipyard 35 light-years behind front lines
- **Target**: Krell Empire Shipyard "Forge Station" (defenses: 4 battle stations, 40 defense platforms, garrison 15 cruisers)

**Timeline:**

**Day 1: FTL Jump**
Strike force jumps to system outskirts (0.8 ly from target):
- ECM ships activate jamming (blind enemy sensors)
- Stealth bombers scout ahead (undetected)

**Day 2: Intelligence Gathering**
Stealth bombers confirm target:
- Shipyard: Building 3 dreadnoughts (60% complete)
- Garrison: 15 cruisers (patrol schedule identified)
- Defenses: 4 battle stations (antimissile coverage 80%)
- Weak point: South quadrant has only 1 battle station

**Day 3: Attack Plan**
Strike Commander (Admiral Zhao) plans assault:
- Phase 1: Stealth bombers destroy south battle station (eliminate antimissile coverage)
- Phase 2: Main force fires missile barrage at shipyard (200 missiles)
- Phase 3: Withdraw before garrison responds

**Day 3, 22:00: Phase 1 - Stealth Bombers**
5 stealth bombers approach south station (cloaked, 95% stealth):
- 4 bombers undetected, 1 detected at 5,000 km (station opens fire)
- Detected bomber: Takes heavy damage, forced to abort
- 4 bombers: Launch torpedoes at point-blank range (2 km)
- Result: South battle station destroyed, 1 bomber crippled (limps back to formation)

**Day 3, 22:15: Phase 2 - Missile Barrage**
Main force launches 200 missiles from 500,000 km:
- ECM ships jam enemy targeting (+30% missile survival)
- 3 remaining battle stations intercept 120 missiles (60% kill rate)
- 80 missiles reach shipyard
- Damage: 2 dreadnoughts destroyed (under construction), shipyard crippled (80% damage), 1 dreadnought survives (40% damaged)

**Day 3, 22:30: Phase 3 - Withdrawal**
Garrison responds (15 cruisers, 4G burn, intercept in 45 minutes):
- Strike force: Full burn away from system (6G)
- 10 defense platforms pursue (slower, fall behind)
- Strike force reaches FTL safe zone (0.1 ly from gravity well)

**Day 3, 23:15: FTL Escape**
Strike force jumps to FTL before garrison intercepts:
- Losses: 1 stealth bomber crippled (will scuttle if captured, 80 crew evacuate)
- Garrison pursues via FTL (tracking strike force jump signature)

**Day 4-6: Running Battle**
Strike force makes 5 FTL jumps to shake pursuit:
- Garrison follows for 3 jumps (15 light-years)
- ECM ships spoof jump signature on 4th jump (fake trail to wrong system)
- Garrison loses track, breaks off pursuit

**Day 7: Rejoin Parent Fleet**
Strike force returns to parent fleet 40 light-years away:
- Losses: 1 stealth bomber (80 crew MIA, presumed KIA after scuttling)
- Casualties: 2.8% (80/2,850 crew)
- Strategic impact: Enemy shipyard offline for 18 months (3 dreadnoughts lost = 12 billion credit value)

**Outcome:**
- Cost: 1 stealth bomber (400M credits), 80 crew
- Benefit: 12B credits enemy losses, 18 month delay to enemy fleet buildup
- **Net value**: +11.6B credits, massive strategic victory
- Admiral Zhao promoted to Vice Admiral, awarded Medal of Valor

## Conclusion

The detachment system enables large fleets and formations to operate across multiple star systems simultaneously. By temporarily splitting specialized task forces for reconnaissance, resource extraction, supply runs, strike operations, diplomacy, and defensive actions, parent fleets extend their operational range, gather critical intelligence, and accomplish objectives impossible for the main formation. Mastery of detachment management—balancing autonomy with coordination, risk with reward, and distributed operations with unified strategy—defines exceptional fleet admirals and corporate executives in the vast expanse of space.
