# Alert State and Crisis Response System - Space4X

## Overview

In the vast expanse of space, early warning systems are the difference between survival and annihilation. **Sensor arrays** detect incoming threats across light-years, **AI prediction models** forecast resource shortages months in advance, and **intelligence networks** intercept enemy communications to reveal invasion plans.

When crises are detected, stations and fleets transition through **alert states** that modify every system: engineers work overtime, security forces mobilize, civilians evacuate, and entire economies shift to crisis footing.

Warning Time: 14-60 days
Cost: 1,000,000 credits/year (maintain network)
Success Rate: 60-80% (depends on enemy counter-intelligence)

Detection Examples:
- Troop mobilization orders intercepted → Invasion in 45 days
- Weapons shipments to border systems → War imminent
- Encrypted military traffic spike → Something big planned
```

Cost: 500,000-5,000,000 credits/year (pay agents, bribes)
Success Rate: 40-90% (varies by agent quality)

Detection Examples:
- Agent reports: "War council voted to attack in 60 days"
- Corporate spy: "Competitor developing weapon, 6 months from deployment"
- Defector: "Secret military base at coordinates X, invasion staging"
```

**Cyber Intelligence (CYINT):**
```
Capabilities:

- Monitor enemy AI communications
- Plant malware in enemy systems (sabotage, intelligence)
- Track digital footprints (financial crimes, conspiracies)

Warning Time: 7-30 days (fast but risky)
Cost: 2,000,000 credits/year (hire hackers, maintain tools)
Success Rate: 50-70% (AI defenses getting better)
Risk: Counter-hack possible (15% chance of discovery)

Detection Examples:
- Stolen military plans reveal invasion date
- Financial records show war material purchases
- Sabotage orders found in corporate databases
```

**Detection Example:**

```
Intelligence Report (60 days warning):
HUMINT Agent "Nightingale" (embedded in Kryll High Command):
"War vote passed. Invasion fleet staging at Sigma Outpost.
Attack date: 60 days. Target: Your primary mining colony."

Station Response:
1. Verify Intelligence (Cross-Reference):
   - SIGINT: Confirm increased military comms near Sigma
   - Sensor Network: Detect fleet concentration at reported location
   - CYINT: Hack Kryll logistics database, confirm supply shipments
   - Conclusion: 95% confidence, intelligence is accurate

2. Strategic Preparation (60 days):
   - Reinforce colony defenses (deploy fleet, build fortifications)
   - Evacuate civilians (reduce casualties)
   - Diplomatic offensive (isolate Kryll, seek allies)
   - Economic sanctions (weaken Kryll economy before war)
   - Preemptive strike consideration (debate in war council)

3. Military Options:
   - Defend colony (fortify, hold ground)
   - Evacuate and scorched earth (deny enemy resources)
   - Preemptive attack on Sigma (disrupt invasion before launch)
   - Diplomatic solution (offer concessions, avoid war)

Result: 60-day warning allows strategic choices vs reactive defense
```

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Connection to Infiltration Detection

```
Infiltration triggers Alert States:

Infiltration Level 2 (Body found) → Alert State 1 (Concerned)
Infiltration Level 3 (VIP killed) → Alert State 2 (Alarmed)

Security Response Overlap:
- Both systems increase guard patrols
- Both systems implement curfews
- Both systems restrict access
- Both systems interrogate suspects

Compound Crisis:
Invasion + Infiltration = Alert Level 3 (Crisis)
- Enemy fleet approaching + saboteurs inside = catastrophic
- Must fight external and internal threats simultaneously
- Resources split between defense and counter-espionage
```

### ECS Integration

**Body ECS (60 Hz):**
```csharp
public struct WorkRateComponent : IComponentData
{
    public float BaseWorkRate;
    public float CrisisMultiplier; // Alert level modifies work rate
}

// Resource shortage crisis
if (alertLevel == 2 && crisisType == CrisisType.ResourceShortage)
{
    workRate.CrisisMultiplier = 2.0f; // Engineers work 2× harder to fix life support
}
```

**Mind ECS (1 Hz):**
```csharp
public struct CrisisAwarenessComponent : IComponentData
{
    public int AlertLevel; // 0-4
    public CrisisType KnownCrisis;
    public float FearLevel; // 0-100, affects decisions
    public float TimeToImpact; // Days until crisis hits
    public bool WillEvacuate; // Decided to flee
}

public static void ModifyBehaviorForCrisis(
    ref BehaviorComponent behavior,
    in CrisisAwarenessComponent crisis)
{
    switch (crisis.AlertLevel)
    {
        case 1: behavior.CautiousModifier += 0.2f; break;
        case 2: behavior.CautiousModifier += 0.5f; break;
        case 3: behavior.SurvivalMode = true; break;
        case 4: behavior.PanicMode = true; break;
    }
}
```

**Aggregate ECS (0.2 Hz):**
```csharp
public struct StationAlertComponent : IComponentData
{
    public int GlobalAlertLevel; // Station-wide alert
    public CrisisType ActiveCrisis;
    public float DaysUntilCrisis;
    public bool EvacuationOrdered;
    public bool MartialLawActive;
    public float StockpileDays; // Days of supplies remaining
}
```
