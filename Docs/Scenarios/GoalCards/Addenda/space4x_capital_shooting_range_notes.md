# Addendum: Capital Ship Firing Range - Nuance Notes

Owner: shonh

## Doctrine and Experience Expression (Guidance)
- Warlike elites: aggressive cadence, low patience, prioritize target kill confirmation, accept heat spikes.
- Warlike rookies: overfire, lock churn under crossing targets, skip cooldown discipline.
- Spiritual elites: bias psionic/mana instruments (focus fire, aim stabilizers) and avoid wasteful volleys.
- Materialist elites: deploy drones early; treat drones as force multipliers; adjust drone roles by target profile.
- Corrupt materialists: prefer suicide drones or risky intercepts; accept higher losses for faster kills.
- Pure materialists: prefer repair/support drones; keep drone losses minimal; repair between waves.

## Experience Delta Expectations
- Reaction time: elite < veteran < experienced < rookie.
- Lock stability: elites maintain lock under high angular velocity; rookies churn locks.
- Target selection: elites minimize overkill; rookies retarget frequently.
- Heat discipline: elites manage heat budgets; rookies overhear.

## Drone Nuance
- Repair drones should activate during cooldown windows for pure crews.
- Suicide drones should only trigger in high-threat target passes.
- Tactical seat decides drone posture based on profile tags.

## Edge Cases
- If drones or psionic instruments are stubbed, ensure telemetry still records intended selections.
- If target motion is too fast, adjust target profiles before interpreting crew skill deltas.
