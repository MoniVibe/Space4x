Status: draft | active | archived

## Purpose
<Why this addendum exists and what depth it captures.>

## Nuance Map
- <Profile doctrine nuance>
- <Experience tier nuance>
- <Tooling/drone nuance>
- <Edge-case behavior>

## Experience and Doctrine Expression
- Experience deltas: <rookie vs elite differences>
- Profile x experience: <warlike elites aggressive; spiritual elites psionics/mana; materialists deploy drones>
- Doctrine/tooling: <materialist drones; corrupt suicide drones; pure repair/support drones>

## Profile Interplay Notes
- Interplay focus: <negotiation | cooperation | rivalry | conflict | environment-driven>
- Expected expressions: <how profiles show up in behavior>

## Schedule and Regimen Nuances
- Adherence is probabilistic; profiles bias behavior but do not hard lock.
- Lawful: high adherence and minimal drift; Chaotic: breaks or reshuffles blocks under stress.
- Materialist: pedantic timing and checklists; Spiritual: brief ritual pauses when safe.
- Warlike: preserves duty blocks; may eat on shift when necessary.
- Corrupt/selfish: opportunistic breaks; Pure: more willing to cover others.
- Needs overrides: hunger/fatigue/injury can preempt shifts; injury sidelines training.

## Nuance Budget / Perf Notes (Optional)
- Budget target: <max expensive decisions per entity per minute>
- Expensive features: <list>
- Fallbacks when budget exceeded: <list>
- Stress-test references: <scenario ids, run ids>
