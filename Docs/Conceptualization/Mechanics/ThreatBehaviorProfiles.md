# Mechanic: Threat Behavior Profiles

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: AI / Threats

**One-line description**: Pirates, space fauna, and environmental phenomena act according to alignments, outlooks, or intrinsic needs, creating diverse challenges.

## Pirate Behavior

- **Alignment/Outlook-Based**: Pirate clans range from opportunistic raiders (chaotic, materialist) to fanatics pursuing ideological goals.
- **Target Selection**: Evaluate risk vs reward; avoid fortified targets unless desperate or fanatically driven.
- **Diplomacy**: Possible but treacherous; corrupt pirates may break deals immediately, while honor-bound corsairs honor truces.
- **Escalation**: Success breeds aggression; repeated defeats push pirates to relocate or seek alliances with rival empires.
- **Encounter Outcomes**: Chaotic or pragmatic captains can negotiate profitable deals; lawful captains attempt arrests, while cynical or evil captains prefer to destroy and loot wreckage.
- **Governance & Progression**: Pirate factions adopt chaotic governance, blending diverse cultures; sustained success lets them evolve into galactic syndicates with unique progression paths.

## Space Fauna

- **Need-Driven AI**: Behaviors revolve around feeding, breeding, or defending territory.
- **Interaction**: Generally neutral until provoked or when players encroach on habitats; some respond to resource extraction (mining noise) or energy signatures.
- **Adaptive Responses**: Fauna migrate if habitats collapse, potentially entering populated systems and triggering emergency events.
- **Rewards**: Careful harvesting or post-encounter salvage yields organics, biotech samples, or rare crafting reagents.

## Space Phenomena & Weather

- **Behavior**: Semi-predictable patterns (radiation storms, gravitational tides) affecting navigation and logistics.
- **AI Hooks**: Captains and AI factions account for phenomena in threat evaluations; some pirates exploit storms to ambush.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Exploration Loop**: Surveys identify fauna territories and phenomena, updating threat maps.
- **Combat Loop**: Pirates use combat AI; fauna rely on instinctual attack/defense routines.
- **Diplomacy**: Fauna lack diplomacy but their presence can influence diplomatic decisions (shared threats).
- **Colony Development**: Persistent threats suppress colony growth until mitigated.
