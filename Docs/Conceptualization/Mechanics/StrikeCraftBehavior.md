# Mechanic: Strike Craft Behavior & Progression

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: AI / Combat

**One-line description**: Strike craft execute stance-driven attack runs, with behavior sharpening as they gain experience and service traits.

## Attack Runs

- **Initiation**: Craft form up based on outlook—lawful wings align in tight wedges, chaotic wings stagger or spiral.
- **Approach**: Evaluate target threat (point defense, shields) before committing; aggressive stance pushes direct routes, defensive seeks alternative vectors.
- **Execution**: Perform strafing passes, torpedo drops, or suppression fire according to loadout and captain outlook.
- **Disengage & Recycle**: Auto-return after weapons expended, hull/fuel thresholds reached, or carrier stance change.

## Experience & Leveling

- Strike craft crews accrue experience, unlocking refined maneuvers: improved evasion, tighter formation changes, smarter target prioritization.
- Higher levels reduce reaction delay to carrier commands and increase survival odds under flak.
- Service traits emerge (e.g., "Ace Wing" gains crit chance, "Shield Dancers" improve PD evasion).

## Behavioral Modifiers

- **Outlook Influence**: Chaotic pilots experiment mid-run, lawful stick to plan; materialists conserve ammo, warlike focus on disabling weapons/engines.
- **Carrier Directives**: Parent carrier stances and automation policies override default behavior when necessary.
- **Role Specialization**: Interceptors intercept missiles/drones; bombers prioritize capital hull facings; recon craft extend sensor sweeps during approach.
- **Model Capabilities**: Certain craft frames support advanced maneuvers (strafing, reverse kiting); only veteran pilots leverage them reliably.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Vessel Movement AI**: Shares tethering, recall, and perception-based recon rules.
- **Crew Systems**: Strike craft crews draw from flight & ordnance departments; training speeds refinement.
- **Maintenance**: Damage sustained affects downtime and repair needs on carrier decks.
