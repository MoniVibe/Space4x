# Mechanic: Dynamic Events & Narrative Beats

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Complex  
**Category**: Narrative / Systems

**One-line description**: Dynamic events weave emergent stories through the simulation, reacting to player choices, empire states, and external crises.

## Core Concept

Events punctuate the sandbox with opportunities and challenges—ancient ruins, economic bubbles, pirate uprisings, cultural renaissances. They draw from world state data (morale, tech diffusion, faction relations) to produce bespoke consequences that ripple across loops.

## Event Categories

- **Discovery Events**: Ancient artifacts, derelict megastructures, unknown fauna.
- **Socio-Political Events**: Guild schisms, cultural festivals, ideological movements.
- **Economic Events**: Market crashes, resource windfalls, trade embargoes.
- **Crisis Seeds**: Early warnings for impending late-game crises.
- **Environmental Events**: Supernova warnings, spatial anomalies, weather shifts.

## Event Lifecycle

1. **Trigger Evaluation**: Periodic systems evaluate conditions (e.g., high corruption + trade hub → smuggling ring event).
2. **Context Assembly**: Pull relevant entities (captains, colonies, factions) and state metrics to tailor outcomes.
3. **Choice & Consequence**: Present branching responses for involved actors; AI decisions follow outlook alignment, player options reflect owned assets and policies.
4. **Resolution**: Apply outcomes—resource shifts, morale changes, new missions, or crisis escalation trackers.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Morale Dynamics**: Events modify morale baselines or variance.
- **Diplomacy**: Joint events can boost or harm relations; embassies unlock unique responses.
- **Law & Rebellion**: Event outcomes can accelerate rebellion stages or offer off-ramps.
- **Tech Progression**: Some events grant tech secrets or set diffusion hurdles.
- **Endgame Crises**: Repeated event threads escalate into sector-wide threats.

## Tuning Guidance

- Events should feel reactive yet fair—clearly telegraph conditions and repercussions.
- Provide sandbox hooks so designers can script bespoke story arcs without breaking systemic logic.
- Maintain diversity to support multiple playthrough fantasies.
