## Space4X-Specific Notes

While the core wealth and ledger patterns apply to both projects, Space4X has some additional wallet types:

- **Carrier Treasuries**: Operating funds for individual carriers
- **Colony Treasuries**: Development funds for colonies
- **Fleet Treasuries**: Task force operating budgets

These follow the same wallet and transaction patterns as other wallet types defined in the canonical document.
