# Entity Progression & Opportunities

**Vision**
Enable entities to rise from "nobody" to galactic stellarch through a steady stream of opportunities: jobs, missions, discoveries, and special POIs. Progress is earned through actions, risk, reputation, and strategic alignment.

## 1) Progression Ladder (Narrative + Mechanical)

**Civilians & Crew**
- **Entry**: deckhands, technicians, couriers.
- **Growth**: promotions through competency, loyalty, and risk.
- **Power**: becomes chief officers, fleet captains, or faction lieutenants.

**Operators & Captains**
- **Entry**: small patrols, mining crews, escorts.
- **Growth**: mission success, operational reputation, fleet size.
- **Power**: command carriers, lead task forces, influence doctrine.

**Factions & Empires**
- **Entry**: small stations, mining colonies, pirate bands.
- **Growth**: territory, alliances, economic throughput, research.
- **Power**: empire leadership, stellarch dominance, doctrinal control.

## 2) Opportunity Types (What Entities Can Do)

### A) Jobs (routine)
- Mining contracts
- Escort convoys
- Patrol routes
- Supply runs
- Salvage operations
- Logistics optimization

### B) Missions (directed)
- Secure a POI / system
- Establish a station / outpost
- Recover a relic / artifact
- Rescue / extraction
- Diplomatic envoy
- Raid or strike mission

### C) Events & Fortune
- Lucky treasure finds
- Ancient cache / derelict discovery
- Experimental tech unlock
- Crisis response (“answer the call”)

## 3) POI & Special Finds

**Common POIs**
- Derelicts
- Asteroid vaults
- Rogue science labs
- Ruined megastructures

**Rare POIs**
- Stellarch relics
- Progenitor ruins
- Quantum anomalies
- Lost fleets

**POI Outcomes**
- Loot (credits, resources, modules)
- Reputation (faction trust, influence)
- Knowledge (research unlocks)
- Threat (ambushes, curses, guardians)

---

## 4) Progression Rewards

- **Assets**: ships, stations, fleets
- **Influence**: reputation, political leverage
- **Knowledge**: research unlocks, tech tiers
- **Authority**: command scope, directive power
- **Legacy**: lineage, history, cultural footprint

---

## 5) Systems Needed (Pipeline)

- **Opportunity Generator**: emits jobs/missions based on world state.
- **Eligibility + Filtering**: only relevant entities see opportunities.
- **Acceptance → Execution**: jobs become orders, then tasks.
- **Outcome + Credit**: apply rewards, reputation, and story hooks.

---

## 6) Agent‑Facing Control Hooks

LLM agents should be able to:
- Query available opportunities by scope and risk.
- Issue acceptance or decline decisions.
- Prioritize categories (wealth, influence, research).
- Allocate assets to missions (ships, crews, time).

---

## 7) Roadmap (Mutable)

- **Short‑term**: define job/mission schema for a single faction.
- **Mid‑term**: add POI discovery/loot pipeline with risk outcomes.
- **Long‑term**: rank progression ladder and stellarch ascension arc.
