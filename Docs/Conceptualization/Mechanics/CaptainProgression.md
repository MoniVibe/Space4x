# Mechanic: Captain Progression & Promotion

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Crew / Progression

**One-line description**: Captains level up through missions, service time, and training—earning traits, promotions, and eligibility to command larger vessels.

## Progression Triggers

- **Mission Success**: Completing contracts, winning battles, or achieving objectives grants experience.
- **Service Time**: Long-term stability awards incremental XP and unlocks service traits.
- **Training**: Formal academies and simulations boost specific skill tracks.

## Traits & Promotions

- Captains gain traits reflecting playstyle (e.g., Tactical Savant, Logistics Maestro).
- Promotions open access to larger ship classes or fleet admiral roles.
- Alignment/outlook biases influence trait acquisition and recommended postings.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **AI Commanders**: Traits affect decision-making, movement, and combat behavior.
- **Crew Training**: Captain training slots compete with departmental programs.
- **Mission Board**: Higher-level captains unlock elite contract opportunities.
