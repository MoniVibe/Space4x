# Mechanic: Colony Development Lifecycle

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Economy / Population

**One-line description**: Colonies grow or regress based on resource access, cultural vitality, technology level, and population trends.

## Core Concept

Colony development advances along a base rate modified by environmental and social factors. Prosperous colonies unlock higher facility tiers and population morale, while struggling colonies lose capabilities and may trigger migrations or rebellion.

## Growth Factors

- **Base Rate**: Each colony type has a baseline development tick (e.g., +0.5% per cycle).
- **Luxury Access**: Availability of luxury resources (spices, art, entertainment modules) accelerates growth.
- **Cultural Average**: Higher cultural output (Cultural Archives, festivals) boosts development; cultural regression slows it.
- **Tech Level**: Access to cutting-edge tech raises caps and growth speed; lack of diffusion throttles progress.
- **Population Momentum**: Growing populations reinforce development; declining populations drag it down.
- **Specialization Investment**: Long-tenured, highly educated workers in specific facilities level them up, increasing output quality and unlocking tech secrets.
- **Demographics**: Track species, socioeconomic tiers, culture, affiliations—their education and materialist inclination influence morale and productivity contributions.
- **Aging & Succession**: Demographic cohorts age, altering workforce availability and leadership pools; succession planning becomes vital for specialized colonies.

## Regression Triggers

- Loss of key resources or trade routes.
- Population decline due to famine, plague, or migration waves.
- Cultural suppression (doctrinal crackdowns) or tech loss (relay destruction).
- Severe morale penalties leading to strikes or sabotage.

## Milestones & Effects

| Development Stage | Unlocks | Risks |
|-------------------|---------|-------|
| Outpost | Basic facilities, limited defenses | Vulnerable to hazards, minimal morale buffer |
| Settlement | Medium-tier facilities, trade posts | Dependent on steady supplies |
| City | Large-tier facilities, local governance | Attracts rival interest, risk of factionalism |
| Metropolis | Massive-tier facilities, cultural hubs | High upkeep, vulnerable to rebellion if mismanaged |

## Splitting & Collapse

- Colonies may spin off breakaway settlements when development thresholds combine with ideological division.
- Severe regression can strip facility tiers, forcing evacuation or conversion into mining camps.
- Specialized industries can fragment into conglomerates spanning multiple systems, pulling talent away from home colonies if governance fails to support them.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Facility Archetypes**: Development stage gates facility tier availability.
- **Morale Dynamics**: Development gains boost morale; regression erodes it, feeding rebellion systems.
- **Tech Progression**: Diffusion delays cap growth; fringe worlds may stagnate until relays catch up.
- **Diplomacy**: Prosperous colonies attract diplomatic attention and trade; collapsing ones invite interference.
