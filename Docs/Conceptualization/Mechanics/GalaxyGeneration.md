# Mechanic: Galaxy Generation & Regional Traits

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Worldbuilding

**One-line description**: A bespoke galaxy layout layered with randomized system traits, resource distribution, anomalies, and regional terrain like time flows, nebulae, and gravitic anomalies.

## Generation Approach

- **Bespoke Base**: Handcrafted anchor points define major empires, capital systems, and narrative landmarks.
- **Randomized Traits**: Within this framework, systems roll traits influencing resource abundance, anomalies, fauna presence, and climate.
- **Resource Distribution**: Scarcity and abundance vary; some regions teem with ore, others rely on trade.
- **Anomalies**: Unique phenomena (time dilation pockets, unstable wormholes) populate systems based on trait rolls.

## Regional Characteristics

- **Time Flows**: Regions experience slower or faster time, affecting tech diffusion and crisis pacing.
- **Nebulae**: Impact sensors, navigation, and combat visibility.
- **Gravitic Anomalies**: Alter warp routes, create chokepoints, or threaten ships.
- **Galactic Terrain**: Additional features (ion storms, dark matter currents) influence exploration and strategic planning.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Exploration Loop**: Surveys reveal system traits and hazards.
- **Dynamic Events**: Regional features seed event chains (time flow wars, nebula-born fauna).
- **Economy**: Resource distribution shapes trade hubs and mission board demand.
- **Tech Progression**: Time anomalies and terrain affect diffusion speeds.
- **Endgame Crises**: Crises may exploit or reshape regional terrain.
