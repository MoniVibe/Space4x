# Mechanic: Crew Aggregation & Department Systems

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Complex  
**Category**: Crew / Progression

**One-line description**: Crews aggregate individual members into departments, tracking averaged skills alongside fatigue, cohesion, morale, and stress.

## Crew Aggregation

- Crews represent the averaged experience and skill of individual members assigned.
- Departments maintain separate aggregates, reflecting specialized training demands.
- Aggregation aligns with existing alignment/morale systems for compliance checks.

## Departments

- **Flight & Ordnance**: Hangar operations, strike craft launch, torpedo management.
- **Engineering & Damage Control**: Reactor tuning, hull repairs, system maintenance.
- **Combat Systems / CIC**: Tactical coordination, sensor fusion, targeting.
- **Logistics & Life Support**: Cargo handling, resource routing, environmental control.
- **Command & Comms**: Bridge crew, communications, diplomacy liaisons.
- **Navigation & Helm**: Course plotting, formation spacing, maneuver doctrine.
- **Security & Boarding**: Shipboard security, marine detachments, boarding actions.

## Crew Stats

- **Fatigue**: Increases with extended duty; reduces efficiency and raises error chance.
- **Cohesion**: Reflects teamwork; impacts morale and service trait unlocks.
- **Morale**: Tied to alignment/task alignment, feeding rebellion and performance systems.
- **Stress**: Grows under threat or crisis; high stress triggers mistakes or breakdowns.

## Module Staffing

- Capital ships host modules: hangars (except pure dreadnoughts), ordnance bays, reactors, shields, command decks, point-defense, medbay/barracks, life support, sensors, and more.
- Each module draws from specific departments; understaffing reduces module effectiveness.
- Built-in vs swappable vs hardwired modules depend on model/variant.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Carrier Customization**: Modules dictate department needs; refits adjust staffing ratios.
- **Morale Dynamics**: Department morale contributes to overall ship morale.
- **Combat Loop**: Department performance influences combat readiness (e.g., engineering impacts damage control).
- **Construction Loop**: Logistics department ties into resource flow and fabrication efficiency.
