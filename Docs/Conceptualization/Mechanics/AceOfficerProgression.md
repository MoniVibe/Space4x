# Mechanic: Ace Officer & Legend Progression

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Complex  
**Category**: Crew / Progression / Narrative

**One-line description**: Space4X crews cultivate standout officers who evolve into ace commanders and legendary champions, mirroring Godgame’s villager → hero → champion arc while respecting fleet-scale autonomy.

## Purpose

- Give fleets and facilities memorable personalities without reverting to manual RPG micromanagement.
- Provide long-arc progression that ties into crew departments, manufacturer experience, and doctrine alignment.
- Offer narrative hooks (legendary admirals, mercenary aces, corporate prodigies) that react to player guidance but act autonomously.

## Core Analogy to Godgame Villagers

| Godgame Concept | Space4X Analogue | Notes |
|-----------------|------------------|-------|
| Villager | Crew Specialist / Junior Officer | Drawn from crew departments, gains focused career path. |
| Hero | Ace Officer | Recognized across fleets, holds unique call-sign, drives mission outcomes. |
| Champion | Legendary Commander / Dynasty Founder | Commands flagships, negotiates treaties, or leads corporate dynasties. |

Progression respects the **passive preordaining** philosophy: the player sets intent, the simulation delivers outcomes based on opportunities and stats.

## Progression Stages

1. **Crew Specialist**  
   - Starts as aggregated department member.  
   - Receives a **personal dossier** when flagged for promotion (high performance, doctrine fit, or critical event).  
   - Gains individual stats: `Command`, `Tactics`, `Logistics`, `Diplomacy`, `Engineering`, `Resolve`.

2. **Junior Officer**  
   - Assigned to a module, flight, or facility sub-team.  
   - Unlocks **preordain tracks** (Combat Ace, Logistics Maven, Diplomatic Envoy, Engineering Savant).  
   - Accumulates **Service Traits** (e.g., Reactor Whisperer, Strike Wing Mentor).

3. **Ace Officer**  
   - Named call-sign, tracked renown, featured in mission briefs.  
   - Gains access to **Ace Maneuvers** (situational boosts) and **Department Auras** (passive buffs to their team).  
   - Eligible for **Fleet Heroic Contracts** (special missions or crisis responses).

4. **Legend / Champion**  
   - Commands capital assets, facilities, or expeditionary flotillas.  
   - Influences diplomacy (fame, notoriety), economics (exclusive manufacturer relationships), or morale (fleet-wide bonuses).  
  - Catalyzes **Dynasty Events** (familial successors, corporate franchises, academy founding).

## Passive Preordaining in Space4X

### Doctrine Imprint

Players assign an **Imprint Profile** (similar to Godgame’s preordain) that nudges career priorities:
- **Battle Ace** – Prioritize combat sorties, duel enemy aces, unlock tactical traits.
- **Tactician** – Focus on sensor warfare, command simulations, formation optimizations.
- **Logistics Architect** – Shepherd resupply convoys, optimize facility throughput.
- **Diplomatic Envoy** – Serve as liaison during negotiations, broker treaties.
- **Industrial Magnate** – Rotate through manufacturers, align with facility experience growth.

Officers seek matching missions, training, and mentors. Failure to supply opportunities can stall progress or trigger alignment friction.

### XP & Renown Sources

- **Mission Outcomes**: Victory, rescue, surrender, or loss each feed different tracks.
- **Service Time**: Longevity grants resilience traits, but also burnout risk.
- **Training Programs**: Academies, wargames, facility residencies.
- **Narrative Events**: Crisis decisions, gambits, or betrayals grant legendary flags.

## Individual Stat Model (Draft)

| Stat | Description | Earned Through | Influences |
|------|-------------|----------------|------------|
| Command | Leadership, authority, chain-of-command compliance | Command drills, mission victories | Fleet effectiveness, mutiny resistance |
| Tactics | Moment-to-moment combat insight | Battle sims, duels, surprise maneuvers | Combat AI overrides, ace maneuvers |
| Logistics | Supply, fabrication, facility synergy | Convoy missions, facility tours | Haul efficiency, facility throughput |
| Diplomacy | Negotiation, cross-faction relations | Treaty work, embassy posts | Relation drift modifiers, event outcomes |
| Engineering | Technical mastery, repair ingenuity | Engineering rotations, crisis repairs | Hull regen, system recovery |
| Resolve | Morale backbone, risk tolerance | Surviving crises, doctrine alignment | Panic checks, special ability cooldowns |

Traits modify stats, unlock active abilities, and feed guild/faction scoring (mirroring Godgame guild systems).

## Shared Stat Contracts

- Space4X entities mirror Godgame’s villager stat contract: every sentient has `Physique`, `Finesse`, `Will`, and a general XP pool.  
- Activity-driven XP feeds these pools (weapon fire, kills, trade deals, piloting maneuvers, facility operations).  
- Each entity holds **inclination modifiers** (1–10) per stat, scaling XP gain and skill costs.  
- XP spending is semi-random within player-guided priorities; pools funnel into skill/passive trees.  
- Three branching trees mirror the stat focus:
  - **Physique** – Overcharged shots, fire-rate boosts, cooling efficiency, hull plating, boarding strength.
  - **Finesse** – Accuracy, focus (actions/tick), maneuver precision, tactical awareness, targeting heuristics.
  - **Will** – Psionic/psyker abilities (short-range blink, energy pool regen, aura potency), education/insight gains.
- A fourth **General** tree handles cross-discipline abilities (leadership, logistics, diplomacy, psionic-agnostic passives).  
- Initial skills (e.g., Bartering, Accuracy) derive from combinations of Physique/Finesse/Will modifiers.  
- Player UI (future) allows owned entities to bias XP spend toward preferred branches, aligning with Godgame’s preordain flow.
- Stat inclinations also modify facility-role XP gains (engineering bays, logistics hubs, diplomacy desks), unlocking role-specific traits, titles, and wealth accumulation vectors over time.

## Augmentations & Bio-Mods

- Sentient entities track limb/organ layout per species; damage and augmentation interact with crew performance.  
- **Augmentation slots** differ by species anatomy (extra limbs, redundant organs).  
- Augments come in tier/quality/rarity/manufacturer variants mirroring facility/item conventions.  
- Specialists:
  - **Rippers** (illicit surgeons) fit extreme combat augments with side-effects.
  - **Docs** (licensed medtechs) focus on stability and compliance with doctrine/ethics.
- Benefits span Physique (cybernetic musculature, recoil dampeners), Finesse (neural accelerators, sensor uplinks), Will (psionic amplifiers, synaptic shields), and General (longevity, resilience).  
- Augment installs influence XP gain rates, unlock unique skills/passives, and may be prerequisites for certain titles or mission roles.  
- Manufacturer loyalty affects warranty/support; black-market augments can trigger inspections or diplomatic incidents.

## UI & Narrative Surfacing

- **Officer Roster Panel** (per fleet, colony, manufacturer) with status, imprint, current assignment, contract expiry.
- **Progression Sheet** akin to Godgame’s: stats, traits, preordain buttons, milestone tracker.
- **Call-Sign Comms**: Ace officers chime in during combat or crises, highlighting auras and maneuvers.
- **Chronicle Entries**: Legendary actions logged for lore and dynasty tracking.

## Contract & Assignment Loop

- Officers sign **service contracts** (1–5 years) with fleets, manufacturers, or mercenary guilds.
- Contract expiry triggers negotiation events; alignment mismatch can push officers to rival factions.
- Officers can **own stakes** in facilities/manufacturers; successful legends found franchises or academies.

## Dynasty & Succession Hooks

- Officers belong to **dynasties** (family networks across colonies, corporations, or cultures).  
- Dynasties pool wealth, share tech unlocks, and influence succession decisions.  
- Adolescents (16+) choose career paths based on education, dynasty expectations, and player offers.

## Title & Rank Ladder (Culture-Aware)

Titles surface an entity’s sphere of control and achievements; localization tables can swap names per culture/outlook/alignment.

| Sphere of Control | Default Title | Example Variants |
|-------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Single Ship | Captain | Corsair, Skipper, Gunmaster |
| Strike Wing / Fleet | Admiral | Warmarshal, Wing Lord, High Navigator |
| Single Colony | Governor | Archon, Prefect, Foundry Warden |
| Multiple Colonies | High Marshal | Sector Marshal, Dominion Prefect, Supra-Administrator |
| Single Star System | Stellar Lord | System Sovereign, Star Baron, Sun Regent |
| Multiple Systems | Interstellar Lord | Sector Lord, Hyperlane Regent, Void Duke |
| Star Cluster | Stellarch | Cluster Monarch, Constellation Patron |
| Multiple Clusters | Grand Stellarch | Arch-Stellarch, Cluster Imperator |
| Galactic Scale | Apex Title (TBD) | Galactic Sovereign, Singularity Regent, Prime Conductor |
| Supra-Galactic | (Future) | Continuum Steward, Cosmos Regent |

- Entities can hold multiple titles simultaneously (e.g., Admiral + Governor); UI highlights the highest tier along with active command roles.  
- Culture/outlook alignment determines the flavor variant used in dialogue and UI (e.g., militarist cultures favor “Warmarshal”).  
- Titles unlock narrative options (treaty clauses, edicts) and influence morale, diplomacy, and rebellion risk.  
- Losing territory or command can demote titles; legends retain honorifics as part of chronicles.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Crew Systems**: Ace officers anchor department cohesion and morale.  
- **Captain Progression**: Captains are one branch of the same progression; aces may graduate to captaincy or admiralty.  
- **Facility Tier Framework**: Legendary industrialists boost manufacturer experience and unlock exclusives.  
- **Diplomacy Dynamics**: Envoy aces shift relation drift, mediate conflicts, or spark crises.  
- **Mission Board**: Heroic contracts spawn dynamic missions tailored to available aces.  
- **Morale Dynamics**: Officer morale feeds into department morale; losses of legends trigger empire-wide mood swings.

## Systems & Data Requirements (Draft)

- Individual officer component archetypes (hot/cold split) with stat buffers and trait bitfields.  
- Renown/chronicle registry for telemetry and narrative triggers.  
- Contract/assignment systems per faction & manufacturer (links to Entity Hierarchy plan).  
- Dynasty graph representation shared with population logistics docs.  
- UI scaffolding for roster/preordain panels.

## Risks & Open Questions

- Balancing autonomy vs player guidance: ensure imprint nudges feel powerful but not mandatory.  
- Performance: individual tracking must coexist with aggregated crew without blowing chunk counts.  
- Narrative overload: need event curation so legends feel special, not spammy.  
- Cross-game parity: maintain thematic contrast with Godgame while sharing infrastructure.

## Next Steps

1. Define data schemas for officer stats, traits, contracts, and dynasty linkage.  
2. Prototype imprint → mission selection behavior with existing crew aggregation model.  
3. Draft heroic mission/event templates for Mission Board integration.  
4. Align telemetry hooks with HUD/chronicle requirements.  
5. Coordinate with Facility Tier framework for manufacturer-linked legends.

## Revision History
