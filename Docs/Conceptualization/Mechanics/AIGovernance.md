# Mechanic: AI Governance & Crisis Response

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Complex  
**Category**: AI / Governance

**One-line description**: AI governors respond to crises based on outlooks—warlike invest in defenses and strikes, lawful good support allies, corrupt use cynical tactics, chaotic balance preparation with unpredictability.

## Crisis Posture by Outlook

- **Warlike**: Allocate resources to offensive/defensive capabilities; pre-empt threats.
- **Lawful Good/Pure Altruists**: Offer aid to allies, strengthen defenses if resources allow.
- **Corrupt/Low Integrity**: Use allies as shields or lures; prioritize self-preservation through manipulation.
- **Chaotic**: Erratic responses but trend toward balanced preparation.
- All governors aim to stockpile resources up to usable thresholds, avoiding intentional hoarding beyond practical needs.
- When storage reaches capacity, AI leaders prioritize constructing additional storage facilities if feasible.

## Advisory System

- Governors consult relations, doctrine, and resource projections before issuing edicts.
- Advisors feed insights from captains (economic, strategic, recruitment) to inform governance choices.
- Player influence comes via direct resource investments for specific constructions; AI leadership manages policy decisions.

## Long-Term Strategies

- Triggered when tech, resources, and outlook align—e.g., megaproject initiation, market domination plans.
- Captains rarely recommend megaprojects unless technological lead is clear.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Law & Rebellion**: Governance decisions affect compliance and rebellion risk.
- **Dynamic Events**: Crisis responses tie into event outcomes.
- **Mission Board**: Governors post missions reflecting their crisis strategy.
