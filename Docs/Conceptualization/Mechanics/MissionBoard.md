# Mechanic: Mission Board & Contract Chains

## Overview

**Status**: Concept  
**Complexity**: Moderate  
**Category**: Missions / Economy

**One-line description**: Any entity or aggregate can post missions to a shared board; completing contracts boosts relations and unlocks chained rewards.

## Core Concept

The mission board acts as a universal marketplace for tasks. Empires, guilds, colonies, fleets, or independent captains issue contracts; players and AI entities respond based on capability, alignment, and strategic goals.

## Mission Types

- **Logistics**: Resource deliveries, convoy escorts.
- **Combat**: Pirate suppression, fleet defense, targeted strikes.
- **Exploration**: Survey unknown sectors, retrieve artifacts.
- **Construction**: Assist in megaproject phases, colony upgrades.
- **Covert Ops**: Espionage, sabotage, diplomatic maneuvers.

## Contract Chains

- Multi-stage missions reward consistent partners; each stage escalates difficulty and payoff.
- Failure in a chain can reduce rewards or lock future stages.
- Chains provide natural narrative arcs without hard scripting.

## Relations & Rewards

- Completing contracts increases relations with issuing entities.
- Higher relations unlock better rewards (currency, tech, access) and priority postings.
- Breaking contracts or failing repeatedly harms relations; corrupt issuers may renegotiate.

## Integration Touchpoints

- **Diplomacy Dynamics**: Mission success feeds relation drift; ambassadors can negotiate contract terms.
- **Economy & Corruption**: Black markets may post illicit missions; corruption affects payment reliability.
- **Crew Systems**: Missions require specific department readiness; high fatigue reduces success chance.
- **Dynamic Events**: Events spawn urgent missions with unique consequences.
- **AI Commanders**: AI assesses mission fit based on fleet readiness and doctrine.
