## Space4X-Specific Notes

While the core production patterns apply to both projects, Space4X has some specific considerations:

**Production Facilities:**
- **Refineries**: Process ores into alloys and refined materials
- **Factories**: Assemble components into starship modules
- **Workshops**: Craft equipment and tools for crews
- **Research Labs**: Produce advanced components and artifacts

**Production Stages:**
- **Extracted**: Raw ores, raw materials from asteroids/planets
- **Produced**: Refined alloys, processed materials, components
- **End Products**: Starship modules, weapons, equipment, artifacts

**Business Types:**
- Refinery businesses (ore processing)
- Factory businesses (component assembly)
- Workshop businesses (equipment crafting)
- Research facilities (advanced production)

**Integration:**
- Production uses carrier/colony inventories (Chunk 2)
- Wages/profit use carrier/colony treasuries (Chunk 1)
- Production feeds into trade routes (Chunk 4) and markets (Chunk 5)
