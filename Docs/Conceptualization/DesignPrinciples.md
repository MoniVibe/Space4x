# Space 4X - Design Principles

Design principles are practical guidelines that inform how we build features and mechanics. Unlike core pillars (which define what the game is about), principles define how we approach design problems.

## Principle: Meaningful Choices

**Statement**: Every player decision should feel meaningful and have clear consequences.

**Application**:
- Avoid false choices where one option is clearly superior
- Provide feedback on decision outcomes
- Allow players to specialize and commit to strategies
- Tradeoffs should be clear but not trivial

**Anti-patterns to Avoid**:
- Decisions that only differ cosmetically
- No-brainer choices
- Hidden information that makes choices random rather than strategic

## Principle: Elegant Complexity

**Statement**: Complexity should emerge from simple, interacting systems rather than complicated rules.

**Application**:
- Build systems with clear, simple rules
- Allow systems to interact and create emergent gameplay
- Complexity should come from player choices, not from learning the UI
- Depth through interaction, not through obscurity

**Anti-patterns to Avoid**:
- Complexity for complexity's sake
- Systems that don't interact with others
- Rules with many special cases and exceptions

## Using These Principles

1. **During Brainstorming**: Use principles to generate ideas aligned with our design philosophy
2. **During Design**: Reference principles when making decisions about features
3. **During Review**: Check if implementations violate principles
4. **During Iteration**: Use principles to guide refinement and polish
