# Space 4X - Conceptualization & Game Design

This folder contains the conceptual design, vision, and feature ideas for the Space 4X game. It serves as the central repository for game design thinking, mechanics brainstorming, and feature planning.

## Folder Structure

### `/Features`
Detailed specifications for individual game features. Each feature should have its own document describing:
- Feature overview and goals
- User experience and interaction flow
- Technical considerations
- Dependencies on other features
- Implementation phases/milestones

### `/Mechanics`
Core gameplay mechanics and systems. Documents here should cover:
- How mechanics work in detail
- Balance considerations
- Player agency and decision-making
- Interaction with other mechanics
- Examples and edge cases

### Root Level Documents
- **GameVision.md** - The overarching vision and direction for the game
- **CorePillars.md** - The fundamental design pillars that guide all decisions
- **DesignPrinciples.md** - Key principles that inform feature and mechanic design

## Document Guidelines

When adding new conceptualization documents:

1. **Be Clear**: Write as if explaining to a new team member
2. **Be Specific**: Include concrete examples where possible
3. **Be Forward-Looking**: Focus on what the game should become, not just current state
4. **Link Related Concepts**: Reference other docs when features/mechanics interact
5. **Keep It Updated**: Review and update docs as the vision evolves

## From Concept to Implementation

1. Start with high-level vision (GameVision.md)
2. Define how features align with core pillars
3. Detail the feature in `/Features`
4. Specify mechanics in `/Mechanics`
5. Move actionable items to `/Docs/TODO` when ready to implement
6. Track implementation progress in code and tests
