# Trailer Shot List (v0)

This shot list is for sim-truth capture only: visuals must come from live sim state in the running scenario.

## 60s Cut

### Scenario Order (fixed)
1. `space4x_capital_20_vs_20_supergreen`
2. `space4x_capital_100_vs_100_proper`

### Timeline Beats
- **0s-10s (Establish):** Start in `20_vs_20_supergreen` wide framing. Show fleet spacing, approach vectors, and first contact setup.
- **10s-25s (First Volleys):** Stay in `20_vs_20_supergreen`. Capture opening exchanges and first hull damage events.
- **25s-45s (Attrition):** Switch to `100_vs_100_proper`. Show swarm pressure, crossing lanes, and sustained losses on both sides.
- **45s-60s (Outcome):** Keep `100_vs_100_proper`. Show asymmetry in surviving force and final battlefield state.

### Keybind Moments (capture prompts)
- `C` cinematic view: use for establish + large movement arcs.
- `H` HUD toggle: use briefly to prove this is live gameplay UI state.
- `F` focus target: use on a flagship or high-traffic cluster.
- `G` follow target: use during volley/attrition to track one unit through chaos.

### Required On-Screen Truth Markers
- Simulation tick and/or scenario time.
- Alive counts for both sides.
- Optional determinism digest if present in current build.

## 30s Cut

### Scenario Order (fixed)
1. `space4x_capital_20_vs_20_supergreen`
2. `space4x_capital_100_vs_100_proper`

### Timeline Beats
- **0s-5s (Establish):** `20_vs_20_supergreen` opening geometry.
- **5s-12s (First Volleys):** Immediate exchange and first impacts in `20_vs_20_supergreen`.
- **12s-22s (Attrition):** Cut to `100_vs_100_proper` for density and sustained combat.
- **22s-30s (Outcome):** End on surviving formation contrast in `100_vs_100_proper`.

### Keybind Moments (compressed)
- Use `C` in opening 3-4s.
- Use `F` + `G` during volleys.
- Flash `H` once mid-cut for UI truth marker.

### Required On-Screen Truth Markers
- Tick/time visible at least once in each scenario segment.
- Alive counts visible during attrition or outcome beat.
- Digest optional, only if available in current build.
