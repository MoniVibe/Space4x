# Space4X Progress (rolling)

Keep this file up to date; overwrite status as work advances. Snapshot to `Docs/Archive/` after major milestones.

Last updated: 2025-02-XX

When told to "proceed work," open your agent TODO (A/B/C below) and update this file at start and end. This is the single source of truth for current status.

## Current milestone
- Phase 2 Demo rewind/time validation; Phase 3 Agents spinning up (A: alignment/compliance; B: modules/degradation).

## Agent statuses
- Agent 1 (Phase 2 rewind/time): In progress. Open: rewind determinism tests for mining/haul; registry continuity validation.
- Agent A (Alignment/compliance/doctrine): Not started. TODOs in `Docs/TODO/AgentA_Alignment.md`.
- Agent B (Modules/degradation/skills): In progress (refit system fixes landing). TODOs in `Docs/TODO/AgentB_Modules_Degradation.md`.
- Agent C (Mobility/economy/tech/time): Not started. TODOs in `Docs/TODO/AgentC_Mobility_Economy.md`.

## Next 3 steps
1) Add PlayMode rewind determinism tests for mining → haul and registry continuity assertions.
2) Wire compliance aggregation ordering and doctrine baker validation (Agent A).
3) Extend refit/degradation tests and ensure Burst-safe paths in module systems (Agent B).
