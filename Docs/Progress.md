# Space4X Progress (rolling)

Keep this file up to date; overwrite status as work advances. Snapshot to `Docs/Archive/` after major milestones.

Last updated: 2025-11-22 (Agent A aggregation/compliance telemetry + doctrine baker + mining demo alignment/affiliations; Agent B maintenance logging/telemetry + station gating/overhaul; Agent C tech diffusion baseline + time compliance start).

When told to "proceed work," open your agent TODO (A/B/C below) and update this file at start and end. This is the single source of truth for current status.

## Current milestone
- Phase 2 Demo rewind/time validation; Phase 3 Agents spinning up (A: alignment/compliance; B: modules/degradation; C: mobility/economy/tech-time).

## Agent statuses
- Agent 1 (Phase 2 rewind/time): In progress. Open: rewind determinism tests for mining/haul; registry continuity validation.
- Agent A (Alignment/compliance/doctrine): In progress. Doctrine baker + OutlookId enum added; compliance now emits telemetry (including suspicion max/alerts), planner tickets + inbox, and aggregation normalizes outlook/race/culture buffers. Mining demo carriers/miners now bake alignment/affiliation. Next: mutiny/desertion demo + scene-wide affiliation pass.
- Agent B (Modules/degradation/skills): In progress. Module maintenance log + telemetry added; refit/repair/health hooks emit events + XP; station-only refit gating + overhaul repairs landed; maintenance playback rebuilds telemetry. Next: extend skill XP/command logs into combat/haul/hazard flows and add authoring/registry hooks. TODOs in `Docs/TODO/AgentB_Modules_Degradation.md`.
- Agent C (Mobility/economy/tech/time): In progress. Tech diffusion baseline + telemetry/logging landed; next: mobility graph maintenance + economy pricing/queue handling. TODOs in `Docs/TODO/AgentC_Mobility_Economy.md`.

## Next 3 steps
1) Add PlayMode rewind determinism tests for mining → haul and registry continuity assertions.
2) Wire alignment/affiliation buffers into prefabs + sample mutiny/desertion scene; bridge breach tickets into planner/narrative consumers (planner inbox + queue in place).
3) Extend skill XP + command-log coverage into combat/haul/hazard flows and add maintenance authoring/registry hooks (Agent B); audit mobility/economy TimeState scaling and pricing/trade-op hooks (Agent C).
