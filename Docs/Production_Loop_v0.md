# Production Loop v0 (Space4x adapter notes)

**Goal**: Share a minimal extraction + production loop via PureDOTS, then adapt to Space4x modules/ship parts.

- **Extraction**: keep current mining loop; map output to production inputs.
- **Facilities**: carrier bay + station workshop as `ProductionFacility`.
- **Recipes**: module parts, refit kits, ship parts (small list only for v0).
- **Stockpile**: carrier cargo or station storage as `ResourceStockpileRef`.
- **Telemetry**: slot utilization + throughput; use for headless validation.
